### Steps to reproduce
Add a select tag with some options using vue with some properties from and object of database.

If you want to have a default value selected in your form when the user enter the form, you must use a **:select=""condition...""**, as of below:

````
 <select>
      <option
        :selected=""true"">
      </option>
  </select>
````

If you add __v-model__ to the select tag **<select v-model=""selected_option"">** the **:selected...** stop working.

### What is expected?
When adding the v-model option to the selected tag, the default value **:selected** stop working.

### What is actually happening?
Should send the value selected to the v-model property.

3003,Positive,"### What problem does this feature solve?
Let me start by saying I love Vue. It is an awesome framework you guys have created, I enjoy using it, and it is at the very top of Frameworks of choice.

But from day one there has been one small area where I found Vue lacking, this is in the Custom Directives department.

I wasn't around for Vue 1, but from what I can gather a decision was made to ""underpower"" Custom Directives in favor of Components. And I agree, when you are developing applications Components is most likely all you need.

The problem starts when you want to create plugins, especially UI plugins. I have created UI plugins in other Frameworks, specifically a Bootstrap native implementation, I have several features that are implemented with Custom Directives, I like how clean they are that way. But when I tried to achieve the same thing with Vue, well I got frustrated very quickly.

Problem Number 1: We don't have a Vue instance. I wish we could create Custom Directives the Same way we create Custom Components. so we have an actual Vue Instance and we can use this. Right now you have to manually extract the directive bindings and store them in the in the element itself. It is not clean since I have to pass the el object around to have access to those properties. It is doable but not very clean.

Problem Number 2: The update hook function it is not being called consistently. For instance, I have this: v-myDirective={foo: bar}; when bar changes the update method is not called, only when something in the DOM changes then update is called. This is super frustrating because many times you want to control the state of your directive based off a property value, but you have no consistent way to know if its value has changed. This is a real problem because there are things that cannot be done without a consistent way to know if a binded property has changed. I wish I could have a Vue instance and have watch methods to react to changes accordingly.

I LOVE Vue, it is an awesome framework, I will continue to enjoy using it and to recommend it. But if this is improved I would have absolutely no reason to ever use any other framework.

Thanks for the hard work and love that goes into Vue.

### What does the proposed API look like?
The API will basically be the same one we have for Custom Components. The example is silly, but I would love to be able to do something like this:

```
Vue.directive('myDirective', {
  data: {
    el: null
  },
  props: ['foo', 'name'],
  bind (el, binding, vnode, oldVnode) {
    this.el = el
    //Bind
  },
  inserted (el, binding, vnode, oldVnode) {
    //Inserted
  },
  unbind (el, binding, vnode, oldVnode) {
    //Unbind
  },
  computed: {
    name () { return `My name is ${this.name}`}
  },
  watch: {
    name (value) { this.nameUpdated(value)}
  },
  methods: {
    nameUpdated (value) {
      this.$emit('nameUpdated', value)
    }
  }
})

3005,Neutral,"Hi,

I am using [Vis Network](http://visjs.org/docs/network) with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and I created two very simple applications, but none of them is working properly.

## 1) The first app is here: https://jsfiddle.net/Filip_Z/9k2s3dgj/4/

The problem is that it cannot delete only the first node (with id=0). All of the other nodes can be deleted. 

![vis vue - deletenode - jsfiddle - mozilla firefox 2017-01-02 02 54 46](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18264428/21583988/1895b128-d097-11e6-8bab-f572e05a0105.png)

In the browser console there are no errors.

```
    Vue.component('ovs-network', {
        template: ""#mytmp"",
        data() {
            return {
                network: null,
                nodes: [
                    { id: 0, label: '0' },
                    { id: 1, label: '1' },
                    { id: 2, label: '2' },
                    { id: 3, label: '3' },
                    { id: 4, label: '4' }
                ],
                edges: [],
                options: {
                    manipulation: {
                        enabled: true,
                        initiallyActive: true,
                        deleteNode: function (deleteData, callback) {
                            callback(deleteData)
                        }
                    }
                },
                container: ''
            }
        },

        mounted() {
            this.container = document.getElementById('mynetwork');
            var data = {
                nodes: this.nodes,
                edges: this.edges
            };
            this.network = new vis.Network(this.container, data, this.options);
        }
    });


    const app = new Vue({
        el: '#app'
    });
```





## 2) The second app is here: https://jsfiddle.net/Filip_Z/3ead4r51/1/

The problem is that after applying the `setData` method, wrong labels are displayed. As you can see in the example, when you click on the button - this Vue method will be executed:
```
                updateData() {
                    var nodes = [
                        { id: 0, label: '0' },
                        { id: 1, label: '1' },
                        { id: 4, label: '4' }
                    ];

                    this.network.setData({ nodes: nodes, edges: []});
                    console.log('Updated!');
                    this.disabled = true;
                }
```
So there will be three nodes but, for some reason, all these nodes will have the same label: '4'.

In the browser console there are no errors.

Now, I'm not sure where the problem is (Vue or Vis)."

Sometimes its nice to have an option to pass custom params into a partial. Like that:

### Reproduction link
[https://jsfiddle.net/alexsasharegan/ojymho07/](https://jsfiddle.net/alexsasharegan/ojymho07/)

### Steps to reproduce
- Create a functional component:
  - create an event handler that calls `Event.stopImmediatePropagation`
  - put the context's event handler in an array with the component's handler, but place the component's handler at the first index. (Allowing the component's handler the first chance to stop propagation)
- Using this functional component in a parent component, bind a listener to the same event (e.g. `""click""`)
- Execute the event

### What is expected?
1. The functional component's handler should be called first, since it is first in the array
2. The functional component's handler should execute the `stopImmediatePropagation` call, and kill the event loop.

### What is actually happening?
1. Execution order is preserved correctly.
2. The parent component's handler is still being invoked (but additional handlers bound through `EventTarget.addEventListener` are not).

---
My use case starts at creating a link component that will respect a `disabled` property, but continues on to various other components to create a cohesive UI component API.

It would be beneficial to have some way to cancel the Vue event loop. I don't know my way around the source well enough, but I imagine that Vue internally tracks all event handlers for a given node, intercepts the native event first, then invokes all callbacks. This is why natively bound callbacks do not get invoked, but callbacks bound by Vue are invoked.

<!-- BUG REPORT TEMPLATE -->
### Vue.js version
2.0.2

### Reproduction Link
<!-- A minimal JSBin, JSFiddle, Codepen, or a GitHub repository that can reproduce the bug. -->
<!-- You could start with this template: https://jsfiddle.net/39epgLj0/ -->
http://pastebin.com/YmfpnjkA

### Steps to reproduce
1. Try to drag and drop any of the list items over other item or the square below.
2. See the output from the console.

### What is Expected?
The indexes are correct as per the console, so the view should be updated to reflect the 'ordered' computed property (which depends on 'indexes').

### What is actually happening?
The indexes shown at the console do not reflect the computed element order"

A vue component of mine, when applied a certain model generates certain HTML/CSS. Is there any CLI for extracting the output HTML/CSS into seperate entities? Currently I duplicate the Vue file with my own node templating generation.

Some CLI that lets you pass in a model and a Vue component, which outputs the html/css file appropriate to the input model.

i try create component based on the pattern facade. On example my component named `Windows` and it would add data variables, methods, watchers and listeners to direct child, which wrap and make component with window-functional.

I can't use `methods: `, because `this.getDraggableElement.call(comp)` not work!
I use this construction:
```
var DEBUG = true
function getDraggableElement () {
  if (DEBUG) console.log('getDraggableElement()', this.$el)
  return this.$el
}
export default {
  methods: {
    implantateChild (comp, i) {
      comp.$el.classList.add('window')
      comp.$el.style.width = '500px'
      comp.$el.style.height = '500px'
      comp.$el.style.top = `${50 * (i   1)}px`
      comp.$el.style.left = `${50 * (i   1)}px`
      comp.getDraggableElement = () => getDraggableElement.call(comp)
    }
  },
  updated () {
    this.$children.forEach((comp, i) => {
      this.implantateChild(comp, i)
    })
  }
}
```
so i I carry `function getDraggableElement ()` beyond `export default`. I fear that, when i would expand my facade-component, file of component turn unreadable monster...

Also pay attention to how i assign classes and styles to DOM of my child. I think that this artisanal method, but i don't find better solution.

export default {

        left: `${50 * (i   1)}px`
      }
      comp.$class.add(class)
      comp.$styles.add(styles)
      comp.getDraggableElement = () => this.getDraggableElement.call(comp)

3046,Neutral,"We are trying to find a solution for being notified before a dom update takes place.

In our particular usecase we are integrating vue with a third party plugin that also manipulated the DOM. We are looking for a safe way to ensure this execution order:
1. vue renders dom
2. lib initializes (dom modification)
   ==> state update ($set)
3. lib uninitialize (revert dom modification)
4. vue rerenders dom
5. lib initializes (dom modification)

We've tried to use a directive for this but this only solves step 2 and 5 (`Directive.update`). We are looking for something like `beforeUpdate` inside the directive to handle 3.

3047,Neutral,"### What problem does this feature solve?
Although it is not documented in the release notes for 2.2.0 and was only edited in the Docs 2 weeks ago (commit 
 bffedab6d824cc7983856b6f286e69f0d818c3a7) Vue.delete does not work anymore (since 2.2.0) on objects.
When I need to add/remove an item from an array it is as simple as using push/splice.
When I need to manipulate an object I have only Vue.set() to reactively add, but delete doesn't seem to have any built-in reactive solution.

If there's a built-in way of doing that I would like to know, if not - is it possible to implement one?

### What does the proposed API look like?
I'm not sure about the code, but an API which implements the javascript built-in delete operator (while maintaining reactivity) would be excellent.

But with vue 0.12 and the end of v-component, I haven't succeeded in porting that code. 
The nestedSortable library is not made to use custom components, and there is always something not working in any variation that I tried.

So, would it be possible to make an exception for ul/ol/li elements to still have the v-component directive ? like the exception for table elements, in order to not break usage with jquery plugins that use list elements.

3053,Negative,"I'm stuck on an issue that cause awkward pages transitions using `v-transition` and `v-view` on poor memory devices (tested on an iPad 4th gen so far).

I am translating full-viewport views to `-100%` _(v-leave)_ `100%` _(v-enter)_, and it works fine on desktop.

But on the device, there is a delay on the `v-leave` that reveal a blank between the two views.

I guess this is caused by the time it takes the iPad to insert the view in the dom, but I tried with multiple `v-show` instead of `v-view` but unfortunately, same behavior here (maybe a shorter delay).

Is it an issue or a design mistake in my app pages transitions? How could I link two v-transition to wait each other to avoid this blank gap between them?

3062,Positive,"### What problem does this feature solve?
I have a large, nested tree of components built from a data schema. Some of the containing components have `keep-alive` set for easy type switching.

When the tree changes, all child components all the way down the tree change (are destroyed and rebuilt according to the new data), but the `keep-alive` components stay around even though they are now most likely completely useless. Imagine a schema-built interface with the schema changing, or a filesystem tree after changing to a totally different path or server.

I would like to destroy all inactive components when the tree changes. I can run over Vnodes myself and check for the `_inactive` property, but this is a private property.

So this is a request for either a clear, approved way to identify inactive `keep-alive` child components or a way to clear the whole cache.

I'm also happy with a reply along the lines of ""just use _inactive"" or any other better way to handle this particular situation given what is available in the API.

### What does the proposed API look like?
(I admit not being very familiar with the Vue codebase.)

Either expose a public `vm.inactive` and `vm.isKeepAlive` to check for keep-alive components or a `vm.destroy_inactive()` method. Maybe there could be a filter method on `vm.$children` to select specific children, such as `keep-alive`, `inactive`, `functional` or any other `_is...` state; this would then hide implementation details such as private booleans.

3063,Neutral,"### What problem does this feature solve?
According to the [SSR hydration docs](https://ssr.vuejs.org/en/hydration.html):

> In development mode, Vue will assert the client-side generated virtual DOM tree matches the DOM structure rendered from the server. If there is a mismatch, it will bail hydration, discard existing DOM and render from scratch. In production mode, this assertion is disabled for maximum performance.

How would one know if hydration succeeded/failed?  If ""this assertion is disabled"" in production, does that mean Vue defaults to discarding the DOM, or does Vue assume the server sent the proper markup?  I would imagine a failed hydration would be something that would be nice to capture (eg. via `Raven.captureException()`) so it can be tracked / fixed.


### What does the proposed API look like?
If there is indeed a ""hydration mode"", can that exposed as a global `Vue.mode === 'hydration'` (or `Vue.hydrationMode === true` if there are multiple ""modes"" that Vue can run in simultaneously)?  Can a boolean/exception be exposed to let the developer know hydration succeeded?

3066,Positive,"### Problem

The event system seemed like a useful idea when I first implemented it. It is still very useful internally, but I've found that I almost never use it in my application code because the accidental complexity `$broadcast()` and `$dispatch()` can introduce. Here are some issues:
1. Their behavior relies on the structure of the component tree. On the surface it decouples the components, but in fact it still couples them quite tightly. Once a event relationship is set up, your components need to stick to that structure; you can accidentally break your event chain by moving the components around.
2. Namespacing. When you listen to an event, you have no idea if a child component somewhere might dispatch an event with that name and screw things up. You just can't prevent that.
3. Events are often (ab)used to trigger state changes, but their propagation inside the component tree is very abstract and implicit. Because the events can go both ways, the events flow inside a large application quickly gets very hard to wrap your head around, and it becomes even harder to understand where your app state to change originated from. A lot of times, a simple global event bus can make things centralized and thus a lot easier to understand. (You can even adopt Flux if you want to go further)
### Proposal
1. ~~Deprecate `$broadcast()` and `$dispatch()`. Other event methods still remain, which means Vue isntances are still event emitters.~~ Stop propagation by default in `$broadcast()` and `$dispatch()`, unless the user calls the second argument `propagate`.
2. Expose a global utility so users can construct their own event bus. Something like `new Vue.Emitter()`.
3. (Outside of core) Investigate recommendation for state management. You can use libraries like [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) or Redux.

3076,Negative,"When I read the post on vue 2.0, I was stoked about all the new possibilities (especially the virtual dom and the server rendering), but I was also surprised and a little sad to that the filters are gone.

They were one of my favorite parts of vue, not only because they were easily usable and chainable, but mainly because they were easily extensible and had a beautiful syntax to use them in the template directly. Especially in combination with `v-for` loops, they were a perfect match.

Thinking that I'll have to use computed properties to replace the filtering for each and every prop I want, I'm worried that I'll be writing a lot of boilerplate in the future. While mixins might mitigate a part of the problem, I still feel like a part of the elegance and ease of using vue is going to be missing.

3077,Neutral,"Doing some local debugging, I found changing this line:

to:
`this.vm.$nextTick(this.forceUpdate);`

Solved the issue. From what I can see it doesn't break existing functionality.  

A separate but related issue (in IE) is when a select element is moved (either the element itself or when it's a descendant of a moved element)  within the DOM, even with the above code change, it will reset and present the same issue as above (displaying the first option instead of a blank).
e.g:

``` html
<div id=""move"">
   <label> Test
       <select v-model=""selected"">...</select>
   </label>
</div>
<div id=""dest""></div>

3078,Neutral,"This is interesting to me. If you cannot change them in the `.vue` files you have inconsistency with applications that are harder to change. In Craft 3.0 I cannot see how to change the lexers globally. Even if I could find this it would likely break any Craft plugins that expect them to be the Twig default.

I think the same argument could be made for the other applications, there may be reasons there not to change the Lexers. I think allowing `.vue` components to change their own delimiters would make sense, however, I do agree with the argument that they should not be changed globally for a Vue application for the same reason. IMHO the best way to do it is to allow the developer to choose when to change them, even on a component that is in a `.vue` file."

3082,Neutral,what @sqal said 🙂 
3083,Neutral,"I believe the problem is that vue cannot detect a change in `labelStyle` when only its children properties are updated, and if its not explicitly used in the template.

A solution would be to recreate the whole `labelStyle` object when changing one style to force a update, this can be easily done with the es2015 spread operator.

So instead of setting the new background color like this: 
```javascript
this.labelStyle.background = newColor
```
You should do it like this:
```javascript
this.labelStyle = {
  ...this.labelStyle,
  background: newColor 
}
```
this will keep everything the same but overwrite the background propery.

3091,Neutral,"Hi @klehelley and thanks for this detailed reproduction.

### What's going on?

Chrome only opens the file picker when the `click()`event's programmatic invocation happened during a user-interaction (i.e. a user clicking a button).

Now on the surface, this is what happens, right? The user clicks ""Add file"", and a file input is added and clicked programmatically. But the issue is that Vue's update mechanism after data changes runs asynchronously. So the call stack of the original ""Add file"" click event has already finished before the new component is created.

Therefore, the `click()` call in the new component's `mounted` hook is not triggered by a user-event, from Chrome's perspective, and consequently is ignored.

You can see Chrome's behaviour, without Vue and very simplified, here: https://jsfiddle.net/0L794s53/1/

### So how to solve this? 
My suggestion would be to change the `Files.vue` component. 

I would add a hidden file input to *that* component and use it for every new file. After the file has been selected, read it from the input, add it to the file list, and reset the file input.

That way, the `FileUpload.vue` component itself would never contain an actual file input.

If that doesn't work for you, because you actually *need* an input per file (I can't think of a reason but you might very well have one), you will have to come up with another way to have the input already in the DOM *before* that button is clicked. maybe always have a ""new"" file in the `this.files` list and hide the last entry until the user selected something, or whatever.

### Closure & Further support

I think this is not something we can solve in Vue internals - the asynchronous update queue is here to stay. Rather, you will have to find ways to work around this, as described above. If you need further help with this, Please join us on forum.vuejs.org or chat.vuejs.org and we can work this out."

3112,Negative,"@yyx990803 Yes, it only triggers jQuery events...and the problem is that all other jQuery plugins works the same way =(

"
3113,Positive,"@thelinuxlich it matters even less in huge SPAs, because building an SPA with a framework means you have to fully adopt the framework's idioms, so the tolerance for API intrusiveness is higher.

I think people advocating the `v-` prefix mostly use Vue as an enhancement to existing HTML, thus for them keeping Vue ""easily spottable"" is important. This is understandable, but it is not the only use case for Vue, and I believe the new syntax is a worthwhile tradeoff.
"
3114,Negative,"I think bringing `.sync` back as sugar will already please most library developers. AFAIK quite a few Vue developers are stuck with `1.x` just because they rely on `.sync` so much. For me we are now developing a UI library and I'm looking into how others are solving this problem. The paradigm most libs are using seems weird to me but they have no choice.

Even if we cannot bring back `.sync` directly, I still hope custom directives or something like this can provide similar feature. But right now it seems not possible to replace a prop/event listener pair with a custom directive (prop bindings are already compiled into the render function and we have no runtime API to add new ones)."

"
3127,Positive,"That's an interesting thought, but I feel it's unwarranted as the web platform prioritises backwards compatibility.

The IE & IE9 detections are locked down; they will never change as they'll never release new versions of these browsers.

The Chrome detection would break a lot of things if they removed `window.chrome`. A [GitHub search reveals 16,427,300 results](https://github.com/search?q=window.chrome&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93).

`'WebkitAppearance` and `'MozAppearance` [have existed from Safari v3, Chrome v1 & Firefox v1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/-moz-appearance). The existence of `'WebkitAppearance'` was deemed so important that Edge also implemented it for compatibility reasons. A GitHub search reveals 7,919,623 hits for `-webkit-appearance`, 1,507,796 for `-moz-appearance` and 510,663 and 115,429 for their `Webkit/Moz` equivalents. There are many millions more results for `appearance:`, which you'd assume are being auto-prefixed.

The iOS detection is less well known. There's also `'WebkitTouchCallout'` (which has more results in GitHub), but I'd be worried if a touch-screen Mac was released, this would also then exist in Safari there. We could also check for the absence of `'WebkitDashboardRegion'` which has [only existed in desktop Safari since v3](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariCSSRef/Articles/StandardCSSProperties.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001266--webkit-dashboard-region), but we'd need to also add `!isAndroid`.

Which leaves Edge. Here is a list of the `ms` prefixed properties that have existed since Edge launched (they haven't changed from 11 – 14):

3149,Neutral,"@thelinuxlich good point, Aurelia also uses the syntax of `prop.bind=""xxx""`, `prop.two-way=""xxx""`, `prop.one-time=""xxx""`, but the template is going to be quite verbose.

``` html
<comp
  :my-prop=""something""
  :my-prop.one-time=""something""
  :my-prop.two-way=""something"">
</comp>
```

I think the special char is more or less a tradeoff between easier to type and more succinct templates vs. being able to understand what is going on without reading the docs. Although the value of the latter quickly diminishes once you become familiar with the framework.

Assuming that we keep the binding indicators, I think the idea of indicating a literal directive also by adding a special symbol before `=` makes sense because:
1. It keeps the idea of ""directives start with `v-`"" consistent;
2. It is consistent with the prop binding type indicators.

Which special char to use is largely stylistic preference. I'll just list everything (`*` and `@` are already taken):

``` html
<!-- current 1.0.0-alpha.3 syntax -->
<a v-link.=""/abc""></a>

<a v-link#=""/abc""></a>

"
3154,Negative,"That makes sense, but it seems like the `isLiteral` option isn't very useful, then as getting access to directive arguments is inconsistent.

Further example: 
http://jsfiddle.net/billiamthesecond/y85usxaL/5/

With isLiteral set to true, and a non-expression argument, the argument can only be accessed via `this.expression` in the bind method.

With isLiteral set to true, and an expression argument with mustaches, the argument is available via `this.expression` and the `value` argument in both the bind and update methods.

With isLiteral set to true, and an expression argument with a filter, the value is only available via `this.raw` in the bind method, and only in the non-calculated state (and update is not called).

In all cases, the bind value is undefined as you mentioned, but this doc suggests that a value argument will be available: http://vuejs.org/guide/custom-directive.html

Is that all as designed?

3157,Positive,"I'm a bit surprised namespaces are ignored, but hey ho."
3158,Positive,@krsrk you found _a_ trouble or __the__ trouble? If it's the second you should close the issue 😉 
3159,Negative,"(This all assumes that my guess of the cause is correct...)

I don't think this is happening just because of the absolute positioning, I think it's just the _ordering_ of the FLIP calculations and applying the style changes.  If I remove three items in one go, then they collapse towards the location of the first removed item (and only the first will fall directly downwards).

It seems to me that the FLIP calculation works out the correct animation before applying the absolute positioning, and that works fine -- as long as only a single item is removed!

This issue is that when two or more items are removed, the calculation fails to correctly calculate the item's end position, and it seems to make sense that the absolute positioning is being applied by the transition-group **as it iterates** through its children -- it seems to make changes to the classes/styles as it goes through the items (when multiple elements are removed), each change affects subsequent items in an unexpected way (so any previous elements in this removal have **already** been removed from the flow before it calculates their end position).  This explains why there is no issue with a single removal, and the problem is only seen when multiple items are removed.

It would work as the user expects if the transition group firstly calculated the FLIP positions for the removed elements **as they currently stand** (without yet mutating the classes/styles), and **only after doing them all** made any changes to the classes/styles of the elements.  This way, the elements would animate as expected.

"
3160,Negative,"Hmm.. The `options` parameter isn't its own directive, just a `select` specific parameter to `v-model` hence expressions are not evaluated. What is the case where you want a `select` input with no output (`v-model`). That seems strange..
"

"
3168,Neutral,"This is expected behavior. First because of the [`externals` config](https://github.com/epiloque/vueSSRTest/blob/master/app/webpack.config.js#L9), the app's dependencies like `vue` are not bundled into the server bundle. They will be loaded dynamically at runtime. However, the server-renderer can only load dependencies from where itself is installed. This means it needs to be in the same node_modules tree with your app's dependencies.

Is there any particular reason you have to structure your project this way?"
3169,Neutral,"@murphymeng you would have to:
1. Avoid using `v-model` and `.sync` in favor of unidirectional data flow (`:value=""..."" @change=""...""`).
2. Use immutable data (there's a useful library called [object-path-immutable](https://github.com/mariocasciaro/object-path-immutable)).

A custom element is not a foreign element, nor a void element.

Maybe you have a missunderstanding how props work, at least in combination with computed properties?"
3199,Neutral,"@FranzSkuffka @yyx990803 I encountered a very similar problem when using Vue to [wrap](https://github.com/xkjyeah/vue-google-maps/issues/39) the [Google Maps OverlayView](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/overlay-simple) elements. 

Initially I didn't set the `:key` attribute on the wrapping node (used with `v-for`), and the OverlayView DOM nodes on the rendered Google Map randomly and wrongly got re-rendered when the underlying observed array changed (new items pushed, existing items' own array got new items pushed).

Then I realized I need to set a `:key` to help Vue map the DOM nodes to the data array. I first tried to use a `String` type uuid of each item as the value for the `:key`, then I encountered the same error this issue mentioned. The situation is similar because the mounted DOM node for this wrapper component got ""tampered"" as required by the Google Maps API, specifically the root node's `position` style property is changed to `absolute`, and `left` and `top` changed to the appropriate ones for them to display on the map correctly based on the item's `lat` and `lng`.

Then I changed to use a POJO `{ location: { lat: <Number>, lng: <Number> } }` as the value for the `:key`, both issues are solved: DOM nodes are updated correctly with underlying array change, and no longer seeing the exception mentioned in this issue `DOMException: Failed to execute 'insertBefore' on 'Node': The node before which the new node is to be inserted is not a child of this node.`.

I guess because the `:key` is a POJO, which is an instance of Object, that's not passed around by value (initially I used String), but by reference, helped to work around the issue?"

3203,Neutral,"since `_.remove` doesn't work with Vue, I ended up simply creating a method that traverses the object and deletes the element marked for deletion regardless of the depth.  here's the method I created granted it was my first pass at it.

```
    deepClean (obj, keys) {
      if (keys.length === 0) return

      let currkey = keys[0]

      if (keys.length === 1) {
        obj.splice(currkey, 1)

        keys.splice(0, 1)
        this.deepClean(obj[currkey], keys)
      }
    }
```
and the way I use it is I build the path to what I want deleted as an array so `this.whatever.0.children.5.children.9` would be the element path, I'd pass 
```
deepClean (this.whatever, [0,'children',5,'children',9]) 
```
and whant ends up happening is this.whatever gets updated accordingly regardless of depth.

Right now, a non required prop with no value never runs the validator which means that in order to support your usecase, we'll have to run the validator even when a value is not provided, which will show a warning (or throw an error depending of the validator) for other people using them to actually validate the information. Basically, I think `validator` is the wrong place to do this.
We could maybe support a function for `required` that gets passed all the props:

```js
required: ({a, b}) => a || b

3245,Negative,"Why the separate `prop-` prefix? Why not just use `bind-` for properties too? And if there's no `bind-` prefix, it becomes a literal string.

I'm also torn about losing mustaches. This makes sense, and it would be nice to still be able to do it:

```
<p class=""a b {{c}}"" title=""More info: {{foo}}"">{{bar}}</p>
<my-component foo=""foo-{{bar}}"">{{baz}}</my-component>
```

(if `bar === 123`, the value of foo in my-component here should be the string ""foo-123"").

But then you have this:

```
<my-component foo=""{{bar}}"">{{baz}}</my-component>
```

This should mean that the value of foo is always a string, and it's always a one-way binding, the same way `<input value=""{{foo}}"" />` works. It actually means `bind-foo=""bar""` (so you can do `foo=""{{'123'}}""` to pass a string and `foo=""{{123}}""` to pass a number), and it would break BC to change that.
If it were changed to just string templating, which would be consistent, the difference between this and `bind-` would be subtle and confusing. It would make sense, but only if you think about it.

Also, taking this to its logical extreme:

```
<my-component bind-foo=""prop{{bar}}"">{{baz}}</my-component>
```

which would mean bind `foo` to the variable whose name starts with `""prop""` and ends with the value in `bar`.

For learning more, I extended your jsfiddle into an Accordion list with a nice slideTransition. http://jsfiddle.net/jola16/v24SV/
It works quite nice, but I now run into a different _problem_:

How can/should a parent VM access its children VMs (created by a v-repeat)? I ended up with this ugly code accessing the internal state of the parent VM:

``` javascript
                var childCompilers = this.$compiler.childCompilers;
                for (i = 0; i < childCompilers.length; i++) {
                    var childItem = childCompilers[i].vm;
                    ...
```

I guess/hope there is some other better way?
"
3249,Negative,"I've never used two-way filters, but I would really miss the filters! I can (and sometimes I do) use computed properties, but in some simple cases, it is a convenience that really speeds up the workflow.

Consider this very simple example 

``` html
<input type=""text"" v-model=""filter"">

<ul>
    <li v-for=""item in items | filterBy filter"">{{ item }}</li>
</ul>
```

The above is so much easier to write in cases where it's not required to have some more complex filtering.

Now compare it to the following

``` html
<input type=""text"" v-model=""filter"">

<ul>
    <li v-for=""item in filteredItems"">{{ item }}</li>
</ul>
```

``` javascript
new Vue({
    el: 'body',

    data: {
        items: [],
        filter: ''
    },

    computed: {
        filteredItems() {
            var self = this
            return this.items.filter(function(item) {
                return item.indexOf(self.filter) > -1
            })
        }
    }
})
```

I'm not saying the second one is hard to write, but when you use it in many places, you will start repeating yourself, and it just takes some extra time you could perhaps use on some other, more useful features!

Either way I will stay a happy Vue user, just sharing my opinion on the filters being deprecated!

On the other hand, as of the [migration guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/migration.html#Filters), filters in directives (including `v-bind`) were deprecated.

Unfortunately, yes, it is. The `v-on` directive is an exception because you often need to execute an inline statement. On the other hand, a custom directive, as other directives, expects a value. This would also be a breaking change

You can already pass a function (no params):

```html
<element v-directive=""dontCallMeNow""></element>
```

and, as in your example, bind arguments with `bind`

```html
<element v-directive=""dontCallMeNow.bind(null, parameter)""></element>

3264,Negative,"The fiddle isn't really reproducing the issue, so I can only give vague feedback.

`<keep-alive>` is designed for the case where it has one direct child component that is being toggled - it can't work if you have `v-for` inside it, nor does it work if you wrap it on the entire `<transition-group>` (unless you are toggling the transition group instead).

More importantly - I don't think it's a good idea using `<keep-alive>` for state preservation like this, especially with `v-for` and `<transition-group>` involved, both of which are inherently working with **lists** instead of a single toggled child. I recommend thinking from another angle - hoist the ratings state out into a shared state object or a vuex store so that it's unaffected by the components' lifecycles."

3281,Positive,"Hello Astra-git,

thanks for your report and the provided reproduction fiddle.

Did you provide the correct version of your fiddle? it's missing the exernal vue.js file library and the template for the `test` component (which you nest in itself without a clear reason/relation to the issue) seems unfinished.

I can kind of see what you refer to, but it's not really conclusive.

Anyways, what I  think is happening is that your code kind of gets ahead of itself and runs in a circle:
- you set the prop `this.parentNumber` to `1`
- This will trigger the two-way sync and propagate the value to the item in the parent.
- But you also set `this.item.number` to 0 immediatly afterwards - and you do this on the _original object_, not the `parentNumber` prop.

So now we have some kind of a race condition: you change a two-way prop which triggers an event to update the parent element, and at the same time you update said parent element dírectly, which should trigger a downwards update of the prop `parentNumber` ...

The result now depends when which reactive update event fires, beause reactive updates are async:
- first, the direct update of `this.item.number` succeeds, because this happens synchroneously. the parent object' number property is now `0`
- only then, after the stack is done, the reactive update to the parent from the two-way prop comes along, changing it to 1,
- ...and the first change to 0 already triggered a rreactive event downwards, changing the prop `parentNumber` to 0.

This is a first guess/observation, but the bottom line is, ttwo-way bindings are a bitch to debug, especially when you tinker with both sides of the binding at the same time (if setting to 0 and to 1 is done on `this.parentNumber`, everything behaves normally).

So I don't think it's a bug, but simply a side-effect of an anti-pattern when working with two-way bindings.

"
3284,Neutral,"This bites me some times, too. I'd vote to at least generate a warning in case `v-model` encounters an `undefined`.

In my case I have to introduce the boilerplate if the form content is dynamic, e.g. multiple instances can be created by an `add` button. For example:

```html
<div v-for='item in items'>
  <input type=""text"" v-model=""item.first_name""></input>
  <input type=""text"" v-model=""item.last_name""></input>
  ... 10 more inputs ...
</div>
<button @click.prevent='add_new_item'>Add new item</button>
```

```js
...
props: {
  items: {
    handler: Array,
    default() { return [] }
  }
},
methods: {
  add_new_item() {
    // `this.items.push({})` does not work
    // instead each attribute must be provided for reactivity:
    this.items.push({
      first_name: '',
      last_name: '',
      ... 10 more keys ...
   })
  }
}
...
```

It often happened to me that I added a new input in the template but forgot to add the key in the `add_new_item()` method. So at least a warning would be nice if the property is `undefined`.

"
3302,Negative,"Not sure if this is a bug or a misunderstanding of the way timeouts should work.

When specifiying a timeout on an observable in combination with a Scheduler to observeOn, the exception exception handling code does not occur on the scheduler but on an RxComputationThread. For an example see the test class below. This has 2 tests which both create an Observable and modify it to observe on a custom scheduler with a single named thread. One throws an exception explicitly and we can see the onError() method being called on the named thread. The second specifies a timeout of 100ms then delays by a second before sending emissions, so causing a TimeoutException - however this exception happens on a computation thread.

In my production code I'm using JavaFX and am specifying a scheduler that runs on the JavaFX thread so I can update controls and display error popups safely, but if a timeout occurs I'm having to wrap in a  Runnable and call Platform.runLater() which seems to defeat the point. I can't find any explicit documentation on this so not sure whether this is intentional or a bug, or whether I'm using it incorrectly.

**EDIT**: It seems that ordering the timeout() call **before** the observeOn() call has the desired result - is this the way it should be used?

I don't remember exactly why `CHANGES.md` was introduced but my assumption is that searching inside it via CTRL+F is simpler than searching within the [Releases](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/releases) tab.

Options:

- Keep it.
- Drop it.
- Use a dedicated wiki page instead.

I'm not completely sure about, if this is a potential problem.
In rx.internal.operators.OperatorDebounceWithTime, there is DebounceState with a member boolean variable ""emitting"", which shall protect against a race condition.

Afaik this variable must be declared as volatile to ensure, the other thread reading this variable is really seeing it changed.

3314,Neutral,"I have a library using v2 `Observable.just` like this:

``` java
return Observable.just(frame);

but the performance degrades compared with my creating a `Publisher` manually. I then tried this:

``` java
return (Subscriber<? super Frame> s) -> {
    s.onSubscribe(new ScalarSubscription<Frame>(s, frame));
};
```

The perf is then more-or-less equal. 

Here are perf numbers of my library with everything else the same except for the 3 variants of `just`.

Manual `Publisher`:

```
Iteration   1: 3602663.765 ops/s

```
Iteration   1: 3520232.687 ops/s
Iteration   2: 3487323.518 ops/s
Iteration   3: 3520324.490 ops/s
Iteration   4: 3502789.786 ops/s

Iteration   4: 3192566.805 ops/s
Iteration   5: 3218123.155 ops/s

It seems that the cost may be because `Observable.just` requires allocating both a `Publisher` and an `Observable`. I'll dig further to see if we can eliminate this overhead.

Therefore, the code below `request(long)` in `onSubscribe(Subscription)` would be executed after `onNext(T)` and `onComplete()`.

```
Flowable.just(1, 2, 3).subscribe(new Subscriber<Integer>() {

I can avoid this by calling `request(long)` at the end of `onSubscribe()`.

Since `request(long)` acts this way, if I want to do something in `onStart()`, I have to put `super.onStart()` on the bottom of `onStart()`.

```
@Override
protected void onStart() {
  initialize();
  super.onStart();
}
```

If I write below, `intitalize()` would be called after `onComplete()`.

```
@Override
protected void onStart() {
  super.onStart();
  initialize();
}
```

I think that this is a problem since developers always have to care about where they writie a request method.

3326,Neutral,"I'm quite new to this RX stuff so forgive me if there something simple I'm missing here.

I was trying to use scan and found that it did not behave as I expected. This code illustrates how:

``` java
public class ScanIssue
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException
    {
        PublishSubject<Integer> source  = PublishSubject.create();

        Func2<Integer, Integer, Integer> accumulator = new Func2<Integer, Integer, Integer>()
        {
            @Override
            public Integer call(Integer a, Integer b)
            {
                return a + b;
            }
        };

        Observable<Integer> scan = Observable.scan(source, accumulator);
//        Observable<Integer> scan = Observable.scan(source, 0, accumulator);


        print(""A"", scan);
        print(""B"", scan);
        print(""C"", scan);
//        print(""D"", scan);
//        print(""E"", scan);

        Thread.sleep(1000);
        source.onNext(1);
        Thread.sleep(1000);
        source.onNext(1);
    }

    private static <T> void print(final String prefix, Observable<T> source)
    {
        source.subscribe(new Action1<T>()
        {
            @Override
            public void call(T s)
            {
                System.out.println(prefix + "": "" + s);
            }
        });
    }
}
```

I would expect it to output nothing on the first `onNext` and this on the second:

```
A: 2
B: 2
C: 2
```

Where I don't care about the order of A,B & C.

But instead it outputs this on the first one:

```
B: 1
B: 2
B: 3
```

and this on the second:

```
B: 4
B: 5
B: 6
```

_B_ can be any of A, B and C but always the same all 6 times.
- If I switch to the one with initial value it works as I expect
- The more subscriptions I add the worse it gets
- The type of source does not seem to matter (tried with a hand rolled one)

3330,Negative,"Observable.create is deprecated and instead comment advises to use Observable.apply:
https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/blob/master/language-adaptors/rxjava-scala/src/main/scala/rx/lang/scala/Observable.scala#L2589

The problem is, there is no way to supply unsubscribe action via ""apply"" function. 
For example: 

``` scala
val sub = Observable.apply[Int](observer => {
      println(""created"")
      Subscription({println(""Unsubscribed"")})
    }).subscribe(println(_), e => println(""error""), () => println(""complete1""))

    readLine()
    sub.unsubscribe()
    println(""complete"")
    readLine()
```

will never produce ""Unsubscribed"" string. To make it worse, replacing ""create"" with ""apply"" will compile and initialize subscription properly, it is only unsubscribe will stop work. 
If I have some resource created when subscribing (thread or socket), I'd like to be able to shutdown it. I do not see how it can be done if ""create"" is deprecated.

Also I could not find any unit test which would cover this use case. Subscription ""unsubscribe' actions are tested without integration with observable, so possible error when ""unsubscribe"" is not called is missing.
"
3331,Neutral,"Instead of multiple `compositeSubscription.add(subscription)` calls, it would be nice to be able to do something like `compositeSubscription.add(Subscription... subscriptions)`.

Currently you can only do something like this in the constructor for `CompositeSubscription`.

Maybe I missed something, but apparently there is no stock solution in RxJava to achieve this. Currently, I use a custom `Operator`. Would it make sense to add such an `Operator` along with its corresponding `Observable.mapError` / `Single.mapError` methods to RxJava directly?
"
3333,Neutral,"Noticed this behavior using rx-netty as internally it does a take(1) internally:

```
    AtomicLong inc = new AtomicLong(0);
    Observable.OnSubscribe<Long> onSubscribe = subscriber -> {
        final long emit = inc.getAndIncrement();
        LOGGER.info(""Emitting: {}"", emit);
        subscriber.onNext(emit);
        subscriber.onCompleted();
    };

    LOGGER.info(""DONE: {}"", Observable.create(onSubscribe)
                    .retryWhen(attempt -> attempt.zipWith(Observable.range(1, 4), (n, i) -> i))
                    .toBlocking()
                    .first()
    );
```

The test output is:
    Emitting: 0
    Emitting: 1
    DONE: 0

As you can see the observable is subscribed to twice. This is because take, in combination with single, causes the retryWhen producer to request another item.

3335,Negative,"It looks like `throwIfFatal()` has some special cases for fatal errors, but `AssertionError` isn't included for some reason.  It seems to me that _all_ descendants of `Error` should be thrown as fatal (I've read the discussion about RxJava switching to using `Throwable` instead of `Exception`).

The issue I'm having is that my unit tests are failing without any reasonable error message.  This is because a mock object is throwing an `AssertionError` which is being swallowed by some observable and passed through `onError()`.  However, if I add `AssertionError` as another case in `throwIfFatal()`, then the errors bubble up correctly.

3342,Negative,"# The Problem:

Creating Back-Pressure Enabled Observables that produce data from a non-blocking source is hard and our current APIs for creating arbitrary observables do not lend towards creating observables that respect the back pressure rules. Users have a choice between calling one of the Observable static method to generate standard case observables using well known patterns or they can attempt to implement a responsible observable out of an `OnSubscribe<T>`. I will define a ""responsible Observable"" to be an observable that does the following:
- calls `subscriber.onNext(t)` only when the `subscriberCapacity > 0` where `subscriberCapacity` is the sum of the integer arguments for all invocations of `producer.request(n)` minus the number of calls made to `subscriber.onNext(t)`.
- calls `subscriber.onCompleted()` or `subscriber.onError(e)` only once.
- does not call `subscriber.onNext(t)` concurrently.

The onSubscribe lifecycle of a responsible observable should fit within the following lifecycle.
1. The `onSubscribe.call(Subscriber<T>)` method is invoked by the `Observable.subscribe(Subscriber<T>)` method.
2. The OnSubscribe func creates a `Producer` via the `subscriber.setProducer(Producer<T>)` method. At some point in the (potentially distant) future the subscriber may call `producer.request(n)`. This signals to the observable that capacity is allocated  in the subscriber.
   3a. Values are produced via a call to `subscriber.onNext(t)`.
   3b. At some point a terminal event is emitted via `onCompleted` or `onError`.

This allows for many different variations of control flow given that onNexts could possibly be scheduled, data could be pre-fetched, excess data could be batched or dropped, etc...
# Proposal

With this ground work in mind I would like to start a discussion about a general framework that correctly models the various use cases, particularly with respects to the following requirements:
- capable of paginating data across multiple requests
- batching requests
- hot and cold data sources
- async and blocking onNexts
## Naive Implementation

User provides callbacks that the framework will call between each of the steps above. That is
1. Observable calls `onSubscribe.call(s)`
2. The framework's onSubscribe calls: `S dataState = onSubscribeGenerator.call()`
3. Next the onSubscribe calls: `subscriber.setProducer(p)` setting a framework Producer
4. At some point the request is received by our producer `p.request(n)`
5. Then the framework will call the user provided request callback and store the new resultant `dataState` for future requests. `dataState = onRequestCallback.call(dataState, n, s)`

Obvious short comings of this approach: Order may not be preserved across multiple requests if the `onRequestCallback` schedules the onNext. Also onNexts may be concurrent so the subscriber must be wrapped with a serializing subscriber. Also, a case could be made that many observables created should specify the backpressure strategy. Any thoughts are welcome. 
"
3343,Neutral,"The `Subscriptions.create` method is extremely useful but poorly named. Is there a reason that it does not have a more semantic name which emphasizes the nature of the action being for unsubscribe rather than on subscribe?

When you read code like this:

``` java
subscription.add(Subscriptions.create(() -> runnable.run()));
```

it is not at all apparent that this code is for unsubscription.

Something along the lines of `unsubscribeAction`, `withUnsubscribeAction`, or `doOnUnsubscribe` would add a ton of clarity to the readability of this code.

``` java
subscription.add(Subscriptions.unsubscribeAction(() -> runnable.run()));
subscription.add(Subscriptions.withUnsubscribeAction(() -> runnable.run()));
subscription.add(Subscriptions.doOnUnsubscribe(() -> runnable.run()));
```

Now I realize we can't just rename this method, so I am proposing it as an addition along with deprecation of the original.
"
3344,Neutral,"This is more a request for discussion.

I'm not sure .NET's Rx has something like this, but one thing I miss in RxJava is an operator to flatten an `Observable<List<T>>` to `Observable<T>`. As far as I can tell, this currently requires one to write somewhat clunky code using flatMap:

```
Observable.from(...).toList().flatMap(new Func1<List<...>, Observable<...>>() {
        @Override
        public Observable<...> call(List<...> list) {
            return Observable.from(list);
        }
    });
```

i.e. there seems to be no standard reverse operation for toList. Is this something you would deem worth having in the library itself? It would simplify the above call to:

```
Observable.from(...).toList().flatten()
```
"
3345,Negative,"Hi, I noticed some behavior I don't fully understand.

When I run this:

``` java
Observable<String> interval =

                .doOnUnsubscribe(() -> System.out.println(""unsubscribe interval""))
                .flatMap(onClickEvent -> Observable.defer(() -> Observable.<String>error(new Exception(""Some exception""))))
                .onErrorResumeNext(Observable::error)
                .publish()
                .refCount()
                .doOnSubscribe(() -> System.out.println(""subscribe refCount""))
                .doOnUnsubscribe(() -> System.out.println(""unsubscribe refCount""));

interval
        .doOnError(throwable -> System.out.println(""subscriber 1 error: "" + throwable.getMessage()))
        .retry()
        .subscribe(s -> System.out.println(""subscriber 1: "" + s));
```

I get:

```
subscribe refCount
subscribe interval
unsubscribe interval
subscriber 1 error: Some exception
unsubscribe refCount
subscribe refCount
subscribe interval
unsubscribe interval
subscriber 1 error: Some exception
unsubscribe refCount
...
```

The three dots indicate that it continues infinitely.
Now when I add a second subscriber:

``` java
interval
        .doOnError(throwable -> System.out.println(""subscriber 2 error: "" + throwable.getMessage()))
        .retry()
        .subscribe(s -> System.out.println(""subscriber 2: "" + s));
```

I get:

```
subscribe refCount
subscribe interval
subscribe refCount
unsubscribe interval
subscriber 1 error: Some exception
unsubscribe refCount
subscribe refCount
subscriber 2 error: Some exception
unsubscribe refCount
subscribe refCount
```

and that's it, it doesn't retry. More specifically, it unsubscribes from interval and does not resubscribe. When I remove the `onErrorResumeNext` it's working fine like this:

```
subscribe refCount
subscribe interval
subscribe refCount
subscriber 1 error: Some exception
unsubscribe refCount
subscribe refCount
subscriber 2 error: Some exception
unsubscribe refCount
subscribe refCount
subscriber 1 error: Some exception
unsubscribe refCount
subscribe refCount
subscriber 2 error: Some exception
unsubscribe refCount
subscribe refCount
...
```

Where the three dots indicate it goes on infinitely. As you notice it doesn't unsubscribe from interval. I'm using `onErrorResumeNext` to ""map"" the error (in this example it's a trivial mapping), maybe I shouldn't use it like this. Still, I don't understand what's going on..

This appears to be a combination of the SyncOnSubscribe.next call blocking (or returning without calling onNext), the flatMap being called before the subscribeOn, and the second flapMap taking a ""MaxConcurrent"" parameter.

If I move the commented subscribeOn statement to before the flatMap, then the test passes as expected.

If I remove the maxConcurrent parameter, the test passes as expected (though doesn't throttle the number of concurrent workers).

If I call onComplete instead of blocking from in the SyncOnSubscribe implementation then the test passes as expected.

Is this a bug relating to flapMap / SyncOnSubscribe, or, am I implementing SyncOnSubscribe incorrectly? I tried this with an AsyncOnSubscribe implementation and had the same problem.

``` Java
public class Tests {

  class TestSyncSubscription extends SyncOnSubscribe<Integer, Integer> {

      private int startValue;

      public TestSyncSubscription(int startValue) {
          this.startValue = startValue;
      }

      @Override
      protected Integer generateState() {
          return this.startValue;
      }

      @Override
      protected Integer next(Integer state, Observer<? super Integer> observer) {
          try {
              if (state > 0) {
                  observer.onNext(state);
                  return --state;
              } else {
                  // Mimic a blocking operation.
                  Thread.currentThread().suspend();
                  return state;
              }
          } catch (Exception e) {
              observer.onError(e);
              return state;

3347,Negative,"I don't see how you have any expectation about this setup or how you'd define ""doesn't work"" in this context."
3348,Negative,"> What are the criteria that we should use for submitting to rxjava vs. rxjava-extras?

1. Is it an instance operator? 
    - If not, it may live outside RxJava.
2. Does it add overloads to an existing operator? 
    - If yes then it can go into RxJava as `@Experimental`
3. Does it add an operator whose cousins are already there in some other base type? 
    - If yes then it can go into RxJava as `@Experimental`
4. Is the operator's behavior properly thought out (concurrency, corner cases)?
    - If not, it should be incubated externally first.
5. Is the operator properly covered with unit tests?
    - If not, it should be incubated externally first.
6. How large or special is the expected target audience?
    - If unknown, small or special, it should be hosted in an external library.
7. Does the operator require new dependencies?
    - If yes, it should be hosted in an external library.
8. Is the committer likely to stay and work out problems with the operator?
    - If not, well, it might not worth the trouble.

"
3351,Neutral,"So the upshot is. The implementation is wrong, but it is a temporary hack (probably) and the scala classes should really be wrappers so semantics reside in the java implementation with delegation from scala classes. Wrt to semantics, and question from zsxwing, the call to unsubscribe can return before u completes, which seems reasonable and seems to be the behaviour in the java classes.

generate ""1a2b3a"", then ""1a2b3b"", then ""1a2b3c"", then ""1a2b3d""? Because it starts with the latest values of `w1` and `w2` as soon as `w3` fires its first string? - To me, this currently looks a bit like a mixture between `zip` and `combineLatest`. But maybe I'm understanding the semantics of `combineLatest` wrong.

The current code seems to still ""wait"" for an `onNext` from each combined observable before firing its own `onNext`? I'd love to try and fix that, if you can confirm that I understand `combineLatest` correctly.

``` java
Observable<T> inputs;

      .doOnError(this::logRetryableFailure)
      .retryWhen(this::tryRetry)
      .doOnError(this::logFailure)

      .ignoreElements()
      .map(x -> (T) null)
      .concatEager(is)
)
.doOnNext(this::someOtherWork)
.retryWhen(this::tryRetry)
.cache();
```

The take away here is the sporadic use of `cache()`. This is to prevent later `retry` or resubscribes from saved observable references. I see this as preventing 2 things from happening in an observable chain. Firstly, if there is an error encountered downstream the original producer will not receive an `unsubscribe()` so it can continue to stream. Secondly the resubscribes are prevented because the data is simply cached and served to all subsequent subscribers. Is there a better pattern I could be using here?
"
3368,Neutral,"Maybe subscribeOn has to be smarter about its source (and not everyone else).
I.e., if subscribeOn detects that the source is PublishSubject, It enters a buffering mode and once the time of the actual subscription has come, replay the buffered values and resume as a regular Observer would. This is is different from my previous hack where only the first observer would get the values. Here, everyone who is on a delayed subscription would eventually get the values from the time gap.

For the rest of the language-specific implementations, I'll leave placeholder sections in the operator pages but will leave these to be filled in by folks with expertise in those implementations.

3376,Neutral,"Looking at these implementations it seems that by using zip it will emit a sequence of true/false values rather than a single boolean specifying if the entire sequence is true/false.

I think it is supposed to emit only a single value based on reading the MSDN docs.

@mairbek If you re-read the docs, is it supposed to be a single value, or sequence of values emitted? If single, can you submit a fix? Probably a reduce type function that keeps going until it finds a false otherwise if it hits onComplete/onError the same on both sides it returns true.

where `ParallelObservable<T>` is really `Observable<Observable<T>>` under the covers but you can interact with it as though it is `Observable<T>`. I imagine that `ParallelObservable.subscribe` would perform the flatten before normal subscription.

3389,Neutral,"Hi @franciscojunior 

Can you try specifying the scheduler for which a second `Single` is operating on? e.g.

```
single1
    .observeOn(mainThreadScheduler)
    .zipWith(single2.subscribeOn(mainThreadScheduler))
```

or if you use static method version

```
Single.zip(
    single1.subscribeOn(mainThreadScheduler),
    single2.subscribeOn(mainThreadScheduler),
    (car, engine) -> {
        // do something in main thread
    })
```

From my observation, I think `zip` operator's combine function is being called in a scheduler that the source singles are operating on. If the sources are operating on different scheduler, it is quite uncertain as to which scheduler will be used to run the combine function. I guess it will be a scheduler of a single that emit the latter item for each combination of a zipped items. By specifying `mainThreadScheduler` to both singles, it will ensure that the combine function will only be run from the main thread.

"
3390,Positive,"Well, then you'll have a crash :)

"
3397,Neutral,"More on this topic can be found here: http://www.takipiblog.com/double-agent-java-vs-native-agents/

It goes beyond my skill set so can only conceptually discuss it. Apparently the concept is:
- at each call site capture a pointer to memory in C with the callstack information
- store this pointer in the Java object (Observable operator instance?)
- if debug occurs (manually or via onError) read through the pointers and capture the callstacks for each operator
- build a ""callstack graph"" for the Observable chain (expensive, memory allocation, getting code lines etc)
- if more than x seconds passes free up the memory of those callstacks in C that are being referenced by pointers

Apparently this can be done very efficiently in C++ deep in the JVM with a native agent. In Java however it is quite expensive to call `Thread.getStackTrace()` as it done many native calls and allocates a large array of strings, so we definitely don't want to be doing that on every operator invocation in the happy path.
"
3398,Neutral,"> Yes, wrapping ""normal"" errors in OnErrorNotImplementedException would also work I think.

I'll prepare a PR for this then.

3399,Negative,"@akarnokd  Aren't the `Completable` `runwith` Function argument and return types incompatible?

    public final Completable retryWhen(Function<? super Flowable<Throwable>, ? extends Publisher<Object>> handler)

        Completable.error(new RuntimeException())
                .retryWhen(throwableFlowable -> throwableFlowable.delay(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS); 

produces the error:

"
3403,Negative,"I run into OOMs because of the way Flowable agressively prefetches stuff. I solved it by turning `rx2.buffer-size` down, but there is a hardcoded limit of 16 ([Flowable.java#L63](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/blob/2.x/src/main/java/io/reactivex/Flowable.java#L63)). 

I would have wanted to turn prefetching to max 1 (preferrably even 0) because I'm working with large objects and definitely can't fit 128 of them into the memory at once.

I think it is a design mistake to have prefetching on that is not requested and for sure I cannot understand the lower limit of 16. What purpose does it serve?"

3405,Positive,"> Why do you consider the following to be a bug, and how does this have anything to do with the groupBy issue?

When one subscribes to the pubsub from a different thread it is indeed totally reasonable that he may or may not receive the item that is currently being handled. What I am talking about is the case where one subscribes to the pubsub from the _same_ thread as where the pubsub onNext is being handled. This happens when, in the image, B.onNext(8) will subscribe a new observer D to the pubsub. The question is then whether this D will or will not receive the value 8. As this is all happening in a single thread, there is no need for this action to be unpredictable. The subscription of D is undoubtably happening _after_  pubsub.onNext was called, because it was _caused_ by it. That makes it weird that D only _might_ receive 8 because there is no race condition. It either should or it should not include D in the set of obervers that receive 8, depending on which behaviour you want pubsub to have (as discussed in my last post).
To extend the image:
![publishsubjectissue](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4191409/593119/5f4498ea-ca2f-11e2-8639-5dda6c06e8c8.png)

The relation to groupBy:
What groupBy does is emitting observables that are descendents of its own source. When using groupBy on a pubsub, when one subscribes to these emitted observables (using nested subscribes or mapMany or whatever), the situation described above occurs (perhaps with some operators between B.onNext and pubsub.subscribe(D)). This results in not knowing whether or not the first item of the group will be received.

I hope my explanation is clear enough, just let me know if it is not or if you find some flaw in my thoughts.
"
3406,Positive,"Thank you, that explains the operation. And also shows that the connect is a must, so it is not possible to chain the calls as I did. Then what is the point of having replay() return anything that resembles an Observable? Or is there some autoconnect method too?
"
3407,Neutral,"Let's assume `take` didn't request unbounded, the following setup would still result in an excessive network usage if the source doesn't adjusts request amounts:

```java
networkSource().take(1_000_000)
.subscribe(v -> { }, e -> { }, () -> { }, s -> s.request(1_000_000));
```

In RxJava, whenever there is a boundary, the operator adjusts its input request amounts to remain reasonable, such as `observeOn` and `flatMap`. `take` is not an async boundary, nor `reduce`, `map`, `first`, etc."
3408,Neutral,Closing via #4911
3409,Negative,"I found it also quite curious that it doesn't happen when using a single `Observable` instead of the merged one.
"
3410,Negative,"My concern is that with key function there is a tiny but non-zero chance to miss an item. Why not support better tool for the job (`equals`) vs `hashCode` or identity. The change would be not huge and not breaking.
"
3411,Neutral,"A more specific example of why I was trying this: attempting to flatMap a Single or Observable to a Completable.

```
    return getItemSingle
        .flatMap(item -> store.removeItem(item.id).toSingle(() -> null)) // removeItem(id) returns a Completable
        .toCompletable();
```

"
3418,Neutral,"Ratio using Java8u92 i5-4670k after `Unsafe` has warmed up is 0.4 indicating for a single thread it is twice faster, but is that the same for Android?
"
3419,Neutral,"That only works if you have tight control at every processing step of the request amount, which you usually don't have with standard operators (as RxJava uses prefetch N and N x 0.75 subsequent fetch amounts in the replenishing logics all around). 

In your case, when an unbounded end-consumer comes along, your buffers could grow endlessly. So unless you have a single step `Publisher` - `Subscriber` interaction, it is unlikely you get a solution generally usable beyond a small scope. "
3420,Negative,"@rzsombor, we encountered a very similar issue with a different library (greenDAO), maybe it could shed some light on the issue you encountered here.

We get:
System.err: Caused by: java.lang.NoSuchFieldException: TABLENAME
System.err:     at java.lang.Class.getField(Class.java:1104)
System.err:     at de.greenrobot.dao.internal.DaoConfig.<init>(SourceFile:56)

Only happens on Samsung 5.0/5.0.1/5.0.2 devices in the wild, we can't reproduce this issue in-house.

We have the recommended greenDAO proguard [configuration](http://greenrobot.org/greendao/documentation/technical-faq/).

Decompiling our APK shows that the ""problematic"" class does indeed have a public TABLENAME field:
.field public static final TABLENAME:Ljava/lang/String; = ""GLIDE_USER""

So we can only join your conclusion that it's a weird Samsung bug. Unfortunately, we don't even have a work-around... Kinda hoping the guys in this project can come up with something...

Btw, other people encountered the same issue with greenDAO (note that the suggested solutions such as adding proguard rules or upgrading to the latest version do not solve the issue):

3421,Positive,The JUnit pattern is fine with me.
3422,Negative,"That's not possible in the real use case, because there the buffer is bigger and the source never completes. I still like the idea of the custom operator. For now I'll keep my ""cheat"", that writes the filtered events from the original sample into a list, which are then emitted with a `startWith`. But it doesn't feel right.

Feel free to close the issue, if you think such an operator isn't needed. "

While this is a quickest solution and would work with a `ReplayRelay`, this would have some performance issues as the buffer grows.

This is the better solution, provided we use a hot observable containing the value in the map (don't use `Observable.just(value)` because that will emit once and complete. I've implemented something like this and its working well so far.

edit: here's my RxMap as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/ZakTaccardi/8d5a42c029ae2580e711de05625f1d4a). Could certainly be improved by not using two maps

For the record, your ""no foreign annotations"" reasoning is incorrect. Take a look at the JavaDoc of the ""GwtIncompatible"" annotation: http://www.gwtproject.org/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/core/shared/GwtIncompatible.html

The GWT transpiler only cares about the _name_ of the annotation being ""GwtIncompatible"". The package where it is defined does not matter.

Thus, other ""no external dependencies"" libraries like Guava just define their own annotation named ""GwtIncompatible"": https://github.com/google/guava/blob/master/guava/src/com/google/common/annotations/GwtIncompatible.java

"
3430,Negative,"I don't think this is a necessary change judging by the argument's current form, and I don't really agree with the blanket statements used to justify ""global state is bad"".

> A lot of libraries use RxJava nowadays, when you want to change some behavior of RxJava for your code or some library in particular you also affect all other code that uses RxJava in your program.

To me, a library that defers to this rather than their own scheduler is simply saying that they defer to what the consumer wants. They're aware of this. If they need a specific scheduler, they should use their own or accept it as a parameter. You could just as easily flip this around to say that library developers then lose the ability to easily defer to the execution environment and now have to add these annoying parameters everywhere to force the user to pass in their instance. This opens up other cans of worms too: per-library? per-class? per-usage? What's the convention? Why can't there be a default?

> Any change of global state in multithreaded runtime is dangerous.

This statement is far too general and not really valid justification IMO. You should really be specific as to what states you're referring to and why they're dangerous. It seems to me your main issue is with the plugins/hooks API, which I argue farther down is equally as prone to bad developers doing stupid things as non-static APIs are.

> Because of thread-safety required for this global state RxJava has to apply atomic/synchronized operations to access it in many parts of Rx chains lifecycle which degrades performance a little bit.

Can you quantify this? If it's negligible (which I believe it is), then I don't really think it matters. Even if it did, schedulers are already cached and plugins are only set once, so the perf impact largely only affects the first user. The only time this would happen frequently is in tests, where perf is much less of an issue.

> Some parts of hooks done through system properties, some via explicit API, not very consistent.

I think we all agree the current 1.x hook system is not ideal. There is already a new hooks API in 2.x, so I think this is a false comparison.

> RxJava makes multithreading easy and immutability of the data that goes through Rx chains is a must have, but library itself is not immutable, that's awkward because RxJava brings a lot of functional aspects and immutability is fundamental to the concept.

Again, it's just the hooks and plugins. I would argue these are a small-but-necessary evil to that give RxJava much of its flexibility. 

> What I think of is to make RxJava instantiable and remove all shared state between RxJava instances. Just like any other normal library such as Retrofit, Moshi, OkHttp (mostly) and others.

These are not valid comparisons. Different libraries with different usage and purposes. You instantiate Retrofit objects because it's one object per service, not one global object that's passed around. Moshi has a lot of stateful internals that make an instance unique, whereas RxJava only has a handful of these. They are also not used as ubiquitously as RxJava is. A more valid example would be something like `Timber`. Can you imagine if you had to inject that everywhere you wanted to use it? Simple classes, utility methods, etc all suddenly require DI or an extra parameter.

I don't agree with those that would argue that anything and everything should be injected with DI and mockable, which this seems to be partially motivated by. Like everything else, the answer is ""it depends"". In RxJava's case, I think the flexibility to use it via static APIs is part of what makes it so appealing and powerful. The plugins and hooks are invisible to most users currently, and forcing this to a system where everything is an instance that must be passed around seems like major overkill.

This seems like an issue that largely revolves around the sticky 1.x plugins API, but you didn't talk at all about the improved rewrite of it that already exists in 2.x. I'd like to know what's wrong with that, rather than generalized ""plugins are stateful, therefor rx is stateful, therefore everything is dangerous"" vibe that the current argument seems to revolve around.

---

As brief counter-examples:

**If the goal is better testing support:** I wrote a nice test rule that lets you set schedulers on the fly for testing, and is quite clean. Simply add your rule, and call appropriate setters on it as needed in your tests. State is always cleared before and after to ensure clean and isolated states. Not all doom and gloom.

**If the goal is to make state immutable and not dangerous:** It seems to me the crux of this argument is around preventing programmers from writing dangerous code. Someone could still accidentally set Schedulers.io() to use a main thread scheduler. There's only so much you can do to protect against people doing bad things. To restructure an entire framework just to make something that largely invisible to most users, has sensible default configurations, and obvious when misconfigured seems like a massive overreaction.

---

To be clear, I'm not coming out 100% against this. I _do_ think there needs to be much better reasons to do this than what have been presented so far.

3434,Neutral,"Can't work that way. 

As I said, you need a custom scheduler that doesn't interrupt when its tasks get disposed."
3435,Positive,"Hi

Thanks for reply.

I'm afraid that my key point is not told exactly.

``` scala
val subscriber = TestSubscriber[Int]
val subjectA = BehaviorSuject[Int](1)
subjectA.filter(_ > 1).subscribe(subscriber)
subscriber.assertNoValues()
subjectA.onNext(1)
subscriber.assertNoValues()
subjectA.onNext(2)
subscriber.assertValue(2)
subjectA.onNext(1)
subscriber.assertNoValues()
```

As above, if there are some input that greater than `1`, then there is some output.
if not, then there is no output.
What I want to do is that test whether there is no output for `subjectA.onNext(1)` or not.

Currently, `TestSubscriber` remembers last output. So, if there is no output, last output is preserved but not cleared.
So, in above code, some output(in this case `2`) is remaining in `TestSubscriber` even though last input(in this case `subjectA.onNext(1)`) does not make any output.

Of course, I understand that initialy design intention for `assertValue`/`assertValueCount` is not for this case.

So, my suggestion is that if there are `whateverThatClearInnerValues()` that clear inner state, it would be something helpful.

If so, usage will be like below

``` scala
val subscriber = TestSubscriber[Int]
val subjectA = BehaviorSuject[Int](1)
subjectA.filter(_ > 1).subscribe(subscriber)
subscriber.assertNoValues()
subjectA.onNext(1)
subscriber.assertNoValues()
subjectA.onNext(2)
subscriber.assertValue(2)
subscriber.whateverThatClearInnerValues() // here!!!
subjectA.onNext(1)
subscriber.assertNoValues()
```

3436,Negative,"Here at square, the android team take a lot of care to keep distributions small. This issue does come up as more devs are experimenting with rxjava, and it came up again today.

It is too bad there's a problem with some languages that requires distributing inner test classes in jars.  If it weren't for this, one could consider proguarding rxjava here, in the root project, and remove work for those consuming in android projects.

I'm hoping someone can be creative and determine a way to address the language issues mentioned so that we can use rxjava without increasing the complexity of proguard config in each project that uses rxjava.

3437,Neutral,Okay Ill do what you said.
3438,Neutral,"Something I've been wanting for a while is the ability to use the `RxJavaPlugins` mechanism to assign the default `Scheduler` factories for `Schedulers.computation()`, `Schedulers.io()` and `Schedulers.newThread()` so that a system wanting to change this behavior can do so in one place without needing to use the overloads everywhere. 

This could be useful to use lightweight threads for example (https://github.com/puniverse/pulsar) instead of normal threads everywhere in the system. It could allow specific customization of thread behavior when an app knows a better way to do things.

Here is some code I wrote (but have not yet tested) that would allow this behavior: https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/pull/905

Obviously if someone is using a specific implementation directly it would not help, but generally the `Schedulers` factory methods should be used, and if they are then this plugin can help.

Perhaps we can deprecate the actual Scheduler implementation constructors so only `Schedulers` factory methods can be used for built-in schedulers?

3451,Positive,"I've looked into this for 2 days now. I think there's no way to do it.

I'm still convinced it should be possible :)

The nearest thing is to probably using the materialize operator on the observable, pass it to a BehaviorRelay or some kind of relay (Jake Warthon RxRelay library) and use the scan operator on the relay to get objects containing both the error the values and, eventually, the state (loading etc...).

"
3454,Positive,"Yes, that was exactly my point. Using `Irrelevant` does not actually provide actionable information for anything downstream, since anyone consuming an irrelevant type means the type itself is irrelevant.

The only advantage I see to having an `Irrelevant` type is having a way to indicate (to developers) that the actual instance being passed means nothing. Thinking on it further, I think that is probably achieved well enough with `Observable<Object>`, since an `Object` doesn't really have a purpose either.

Just out of curiosity - is it kind of implied that thing like 

``` java

```

always succeed and cannot throw? As well as doOnTerminate / doAfterTerminate.
Isn't it safer to always do dispose in a big finally block _unless_ unsafeSubscribe was successful? That would probably also simplify exception handling as now you have two identical copy&paste blocks...

Sorry if I am asking nonsense - really unfamiliar with the framework right now.

PS: you also have a semicolon following .doAfterTerminate(disposeOnceOnly) on a separate line - probably a typo.

"
3457,Positive,"Good idea.  At first glance, I think this could be accomplished by the introduction of an implicit class (`ScalaObservable`?) wrapping `Observable` that implements `flatMap`, `map`, and `withFilter` by delegating to `mapMany`, `map`, and `filter`, respectively.  As long as all the methods still return an `Observable`, then we should be OK.

"
3459,Neutral,"To backup what @akarnokd said, I have consciously not been strict about styles. I generally dislike most of the artificial and subjective decisions style guides make and wanted to make RxJava as easy to contribute to as possible. 

It is all covered in this line from https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/blob/1.x/CONTRIBUTING.md:

> When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.

Beyond that it is left to good judgement and intelligent individuals trying to cooperate together.

A related topic is whether all pull requests must be single-commit or not. This is another where I have chosen to not be strict. If a pull request is a mess of many incremental developer commits I sometimes ask for it to be rebased, but if there are a handful of logical commits with decent commit messages I'm fine with there being more than one. 

Almost all developers self-police on having clean code and clean commits and matching the style of the project. Occasionally we need to provide guidance on improving something, but that's rare compared with how most developers do the right thing without being explicitly told what to do.

All of this aligns with the ""freedom and responsibility"" culture at Netflix where this project originated: http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664

"
3464,Neutral,"The parent queue interface was designed after the Single-Producer-Single-Consumer queues like those in JCTools. 

There, the requirement is that `poll` is called from a single thread at a time and the fused ""queues"" must honor this requirement. Since `index` in fused mode is only updated from within `poll` and poll is serialized by a pair of full barrier atomic add operations, any change to index will be written back into memory before an atomic decrement and read from it after the atomic increment of the drain loop. 

It works just the same as the non-fused `request` execution where the atomic transition from 0 to N is guaranteed to happen only to one thread and the atomic transition attempt from N back to 0 will enable a subsequent thread to do the 0 to N transition again. When doing the 0 to N transition, the next operation is to read the index and when doing N to 0, the prior operation is to write back the index. The full barriers of the atomics will make sure the change to index is visible to the next thread.

On rare cases, such as the `TestSubscriber`, `poll` is called from within `onNext` and `onNext` is required by the Reactive-Streams spec to be serialized the very same manner as `poll` requires it."
3465,Neutral,"That's great that workarounds exist so we can move forward, I look forward to hearing how the autocomplete example works.

If you can get that functioning is that strong enough evidence to move forward with it or are there still pieces of functionality lacking?

3468,Neutral,"Unsubscription has been always best effor in 1.x, that means even though issued an `unsubscribe`, it may free the relevant resources after a non-deterministic time, highly depending on what the flow looks like.

Generally, the `if (isUnsubscribed())` is only probabilistically executed because most chains already do such `isUnsubscribed()` checks and call the downstream if false, therefore, there is only a small window for an asynchronous `unsubscribe` to cancel the sequence right before your `if` executes.

I can't speak for Jersey since I don't know it or how they implemented their RxJava support. Sounds like they disregard `isUnsubscribed` after a long running and blocking request and send out the response no matter what and/or they don't react to downstream `unsubscribe` requests by interrupting their network wait.

To rule out RxJava, I suggest you replace the Jersey part with plain RxJava sources that sleep for example to rule out RxJava and/or your flow setup."

I'd suggest though that the way you should do this is to merge the streams and then observeOn, that's the compositional way of doing this.

``` java
Observable.merge(stream1, stream2).observeOn(Schedulers.computation())

There is a [PR](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/3487) in limbo that tries to address this buffer behavior by allowing dropping, but if you want to queue on disk, you have to write a custom operator.

@akarnokd you can add basic support of `Single` and `Consumable` in 2.x (basically just make library architecture aware of them from the beginning instead of adding them post-factum as it was in 1.x), non-basic operators can be added by community according to its needs as it happens/happened in 1.x.

"
3478,Positive,"Thanks for the details. CompositeSubscription becomes very slow when it grows over the size of the cache line in the CPU and constant add/remove is happening (see #1145).

Subscriptions$2 is perhaps the wrapper for Future, which keeps a final reference to the Future object, which generally shouldn't be a problem if its parent container is removing/clearing it.

What is worrying is that there is an unsubscribed `CompositeSubscription` with a non-empty array. When unsubscribed, `CompositeSubscription` should drop the entire array and don't accept any new additions. Could you tell where that `CompositeSubscription` is embedded?

3492,Neutral,"Your are mixing a few concepts, there is nothing to call `onError` on when you block for the results of a source. Since `Completable` doesn't have any value, it allows for the opportunity to get the `Throwable` without the need to try-catch it. For the other types, getting the item is more important and since Java doesn't support record types or multi-value returns, the alternate delivery method for these remain rethrowing the exception.

Also it is marked with `@CheckReturnValue` so a static analysis tool/IDE should warn you if you forget to check the returned value."
3493,Positive,"Hello!  In the past couple of months I've put some time into developing a library for reactive/responsive programming based on a pull model called _choice streams_.  I believe that you might find it interesting.

Here is a little bit of prose on the idea:

  https://github.com/Hopac/Hopac/blob/master/Docs/Inverting.md

I must apologise that the above document is somewhat out of date with respect to my improved understanding of Rx and contains a couple of incorrect assertions.

And here is the current reference documentation on choice streams:

  http://hopac.github.io/Hopac/Hopac.html#def:type%20Hopac.Stream.Stream

Summary: It turns out that it is quite possible to do responsive and reactive programming with a pull model.  All you need is lightweight threads, lazy futures/promises and non-deterministic choice.  Even operators like `groupBy` and operations like `delay` (I call it `shift`) can be implemented for choice streams.  Many operations appear to be significantly simpler to implement on pull -based streams than on push -based streams.  The main feature lacking from choice streams is the subscription protocol, which means that operations like `Using` cannot be implemented with comparable semantics.

Please note that choice streams are still work-in-progress and, compared to Rx, there are a few combinators missing that I haven't yet had the time to implement, although I'm confident there will be no problems.  I'm already using choice streams in an actual application for reactive/responsive programming and they have worked without problems.

"
3495,Positive,"> The problem with pooling is that it can now become the congestion point: multiple threads might want to grab an element from the pool at the same time.

Sure, but if it's a concurrent queue, which it is, then that contention should not be severe. It's using an `MpmcArrayQueue` optimized for performance. 

I agree it is a point of contention, but if that contention is cheaper than the object allocation/collection then it's a net win. 

> reference counting

This could work but is effectively synchronizing unsubscribe and queue usage (cheaper than mutex, but still a form of synchronizing) which definitely has a cost, both performance and cognitive every time this queue is used. Hence us pursuing either a solution that doesn't need to be pooled, or my pursuit of weak references so the release to the pool is automated.

"
3505,Neutral,"It is much faster that way because after the first call, all subsequent calls would fail the CAS and it costs 15-45 cycles whereas `get()` is likely to  cost 3-10 cycles only. Since `request` is called quite frequently, the optimization helps greatly in reducing the overhead. See the `AtomicPerf` benchmark that measures this effect. 

However, if said check is likely to get executed once, the extra get actually makes it slightly slower (something to do with how CPUs behave when they read-then-write the same memory location). Therefore, we don't call `get()` in, for example, Subscription implementations.

Let's pick up that conversation on the 2.x issues though ... this one is very focused on merge/flatMap.
"
3510,Neutral,"Could you run with `--stacktrace` to find out what exactly is causing the problem. It is very likely this is a bug with Nebula and can't do much about it from RxJava.
"
3511,Negative,"Well, it's hard to divide `subscribe()` and setting of initial value (which is `~onNext`) for me.

What I see at the moment:
1. Current implementation of `BehaviorSubject.create(defaultValue)` sets default value to `volatile Object latest` field of `SubjectSubscriptionManager`.
2. When you call `onNext()` it also sets new value to that `volatile` field without any synchronization. 
3. When you `subscribe()` it won't start with `defaultValue` that you've passed as initial but it will emit that `volatile latest` state instead -> that leads to the effect that @sregg sees.

And now I'm not sure that `toSerialized()` will help with initial value because even though it synchronizes `onNext`, emission of the default value goes trough different lock object and still may happen concurrently with `onNext`…

@sregg as temporary solution you can try to create `BehaviorSubject` **without** default value, convert it `toSerialized()` and set default value via `onNext` before giving reference to the subject to other threads, this should give you threading consistency you want to achieve.

Probably we need to define this behavior better either in javadoc or even change current impementation to emit `default` initial value first and only then emit `volatile latest`.

3547,Negative,"Which scheduler? Computation? It was intentional. You can now configure the priority of each scheduler so there was little benefit from a customizing the factory. Use the [ParallelScheduler](https://github.com/akarnokd/RxJava2Extensions#parallelscheduler) from extensions which allows more [customization](https://github.com/akarnokd/RxJava2Extensions/blob/master/src/main/java/hu/akarnokd/rxjava2/schedulers/ParallelScheduler.java#L87).

"
3548,Neutral,"@stealthcode and I did some tinkering on an idea to build a gradle plugin for merging dependencies. The idea being that you could add methods to any class prior to the building of your code. I had envisioned the syntax being something like

```
dependencies {
    colliderCompile 'org.reactivestreams:reactive-streams:1.0.1' {
         merge 'reactivex.io.rxjava3:rxjava3:1.0'
         merge 'reactivex.io.rxjava3:rxmath:1.0'
    }
}
```

The `rxjava3` jar would contain a duplicate the interface of `org.reactivestreams.Publisher<T>` but with default methods for core things like `scan` and `flatMap`. The collider plugin would repackage the reactive-streams-1.0.1.jar on disk with the injected methods so IDEs and JVM would be none the wiser that they weren't there all along. Then the `rxmath` could add thing related to `count`, `average`, `mean` and `standardDeviation`.

Of course that plugin would be an entirely independent project and NOT discussed here in rx java. If you have more questions ping me directly.
"
3549,Neutral,"Yes, 3.x API cleanup can include this type of change. I otherwise always have separate converters for the base reactive classes.

"
3556,Neutral,"How would an operator know how many messages it is going to have? Only the origin Observable could know that - a given operator along the chain won't know so how does this get accomplished?
"
3557,Positive,"Great. I though #1898 was shipped with 1.0.1.
"
3558,Negative,"Right, but users will have to put `@Rule` in each test class, not everybody use JUnit (we also use two versions of Spek in our projects and mix JUnit4 with JUnit5), I haven't found a way to set global custom JUnit4 test runner [in Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html) and by default IntelliJ runs tests on its own using build system only to generate test class files so it'll also require some customization.

""In production"" you typically have an entrypoint (Application classes exist in most of both in front- and backend frameworks) which is a convenient place to hook into RxJavaPlugins and set desired behavior. 

While tests are usually isolated from each other and each class if not method will require customization for um, detecting errors… which is basically what each test should do by default… It just seems wrong to not inverse current behavior.

@akarnokd what are your concerns about throwing `OnErrorNotImplementedException` for RxJava v2 specific subscribers and not doing so for Reactive Streams subscribers? 

Mine is that it can create sort of unexpected behavior if you'll try to mix RxJava v2 with some other RS implementations in compare to how RxJava v2 will work in isolation, but I'm not sure that mixing is common use case. I'm much more afraid that current behavior is ***very*** unexpected for v1 users who are migrating to v2."
3559,Neutral,"If someone is interested in, I now completely moved the `timeout().toBlocking().single()` calls to a custom implementation in the Couchbase SDK -> https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-java-client/commit/4317ebe46c0c1b369f24f88efcf7d48f241736dd

But this only works for scalar responses and not if you need an iterator, but still. (in this case, I even save on a BlockingObservable since the latch directly works on the regular subscriber).

3560,Negative,"Here the error occurs even without `observeOn`:

3562,Positive,"I was thinking about and had the idea of only the capturing of the originating stack track one per worker when the first action is scheduled rather than every schedule call.

3564,Negative,"Exactly what i meant. Isn't it suppoused to run flatMap Observable code within another thread?
so that PRE-1-CALL and possibly (POST-1-CALL) are on another thread?

Did i misunderstand something?
"
3565,Positive,"Thanks @artem-zinnatullin , that reduces `RxRingBuffer` initialization time a reasonable range. Is there any downside if `unsafe` is disabled?
"
3566,Neutral,"See #4570
"
3567,Negative,"yes, that's exactly the problem actually. Also when replacing the merged `Observable` with a single one emitting items over time the test passes, which is quite confusing and inconsistent from a consumer point of view.
"
3568,Negative,"IMHO both @benjchristensen @zsxwing changes are valid and address the original issue with the static inner class scenario. The case where the Action is a non static anonymous inner class and there is a long running operation such as in the example is nothing we can do within the library.
"
3569,Negative,"Observable.create & Observable.just are all creating observables,why they have such a difference? And the distinction may be difficult to find. The official has a similar document can reference?"
3570,Negative,"I would not expect that observeOn keeps emitting null values. That seems wrong because the source never produced a null value `while (true) {  subscriber.onNext(i);  i+=1 }`
"
3571,Positive,"I'm not sure I follow. Exactly at which point has `1` already been emitted? It has not been emitted after the `toBlockingObservable` call, because the second example still yields an item. So, somehow, the `.next.iterator.next()` must have ""swallowed"" one item, while the call to `single` manages not to swallow it and emit it as I'd expect. Could you please elaborate in more detail on what is the conceptual (not implementation) difference between the two? I'm still not convinced that the `next` call should skip the item provided by the `BehaviorSubject`.

Thank you very much.
"
3572,Neutral,"Why is that an issue to call it in either of them? You can pass the same function to both the `onError` and `onNext` args for `doOnEach`. One or the other will be called and `ProgressDialogFragment.dismiss()` will be invoked either way.
"
3573,Neutral,"Ok after some thoughts and practical trials with applications of those Processors it seems that allowing > 1 onSubscription could complicate things significantly also create much confusion around behavioral expectations. 

One other thing to clarify, having we have canceled the Processor what is the behavior you'd expect 'current subscribers stay as is and new ones can be added as usual' ? In this case the Processor can still send onNext and eventually OnComplete which would terminate the subscribers.
"
3574,Neutral,"There is no try/catch in the code example you gave: https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/blob/1.x/src/test/java/rx/observers/TestSubscriberTest.java

Operators will have try/catch, but it is incredibly rare to have try/catch in user code. 

The only time things are an issue is when calling methods that throw Checked exceptions (which almost everyone I know despises). In those cases it is a pain as one must try/catch around those. You can probably use `@SneakyThrows` yourself without RxJava doing anything to solve that issue. 

> If doing some IO operations like File, JDBC and Networks; this sort of callback will turn into a noisy code pattern really fast. Even with a JDK8 Lamdas, the pattern will be the same.

Here is IO being done without any ""noisy code"":

``` java
    return RxNetty.createHttpServer(port, (request, response) -> {
        return response.writeStringAndFlush(""Hello World!"");
    });
```

Please show what the issue is using code examples and your proposed solution that would involve changes to RxJava.
"
3575,Negative,No need. I overlooked `Single` as the base type in your example. A failing lambda can't call `onError` on `Single` but only the global error handler.

"
3580,Negative,"One issue is with `concat`:

``` java
public static <T> Observable<T> concat(Observable<Observable<? extends T>> observables)
```

That works with this:

``` java
    public void testConcatCovariance() {
        Observable<Media> o1 = Observable.from(new HorrorMovie(), new Movie());
        Observable<Media> o2 = Observable.from(new Media(), new HorrorMovie());

        Observable<Observable<Media>> os = Observable.from(o1, o2);

        List<Media> values = Observable.concat(os).toList().toBlockingObservable().single();
    }
```

but it doesn't work with this:

``` java
    public void testConcatCovariance2() {
        Observable<Media> o1 = Observable.from(new HorrorMovie(), new Movie(), new Media());
        Observable<Media> o2 = Observable.from(new Media(), new HorrorMovie());

        Observable<Observable<Media>> os = Observable.from(o1, o2);

        List<Media> values = Observable.concat(os).toList().toBlockingObservable().single();
    }
```

When both types are `Media` the `Observable` ends up being `Observable<Observable<Media>>` instead of `Observable<Observable<? super Media>>` and then `concat` fails. This is not at all ideal, especially since it's more common to be concatenating multiple Observables of the same type.

If I change concat to this and remove the `? extends`:

``` java
public static <T> Observable<T> concat(Observable<Observable<T>> observables)
```

... the `testConcatCovariance2` example works and `testConcatCovariance1` fails unless I change this line:

``` java
Observable<Media> o1 = Observable.<Media>from(new HorrorMovie(), new Movie());
```

Personally I prefer doing that when dealing with super types than making `concat` be forced to deal with it all the time.

If you skip to `Observable.from(o1, o2)` step which confuses the generics and go directly to `concat` then it's even cleaner. 

This uses:

``` java
public static <T> Observable<T> concat(Observable<? extends T> t1, Observable<? extends T> t2)
```

Both of these work:

``` java
    @Test
    public void testConcatCovariance3() {
        Observable<Movie> o1 = Observable.from(new HorrorMovie(), new Movie());
        Observable<Media> o2 = Observable.from(new Media(), new HorrorMovie());

        List<Media> values = Observable.concat(o1, o2).toList().toBlockingObservable().single();
    }

    @Test
    public void testConcatCovariance4() {

        Observable<Movie> o1 = Observable.create(new OnSubscribeFunc<Movie>() {

            @Override
            public Subscription onSubscribe(Observer<? super Movie> o) {
                o.onNext(new HorrorMovie());
                o.onNext(new Movie());
                //                o.onNext(new Media()); // correctly doesn't compile
                o.onCompleted();
                return Subscriptions.empty();
            }
        });

        Observable<Media> o2 = Observable.from(new Media(), new HorrorMovie());

        List<Media> values = Observable.concat(o1, o2).toList().toBlockingObservable().single();
    }
```

In short, it seems the `Observable<Observable<? extends T>>` does not work well.

3586,Negative,"Excellent! Sorry... I am in the process of trying to upgrade and hadn't checked the latest API. 
"
3587,Positive,"If that is the case then mergeDelayError has the wrong description on what it does.
For any other composition I agree.
But for mergeDelayError I do not.
Because its purpose is to handle any error from its sources without breaking the sequence.

From the MergeWith perspective there is an UndeliverableError.
(BTW mergeWith docs also show only one error will be propagated to the final sequence)
But maybe this should not be the case.
MergeWith should deliver the error to mergeDelayError.

mergeDelayError should not care what type of error it is.
It should not care what the behaviour of the observable is.
It is described as my catch all and it does not behave like that.

So since mergeDelayError is not doing what I expect it to do, 
is there a way to have a catch all 
without handling each nested level of composition 
and without breaking the sequence 
and getting an aggregate exception in the end?

Second option is to place a breakpoint on Thread.interrupt() to see who is calling; but without seeing what's going on in your system, the interrupt may come from somewhere else entirely. I'm not familiar with Flightrecorder but the mere observation of your system may trigger interrupts, wouldn't be surprised.

In 0.29.0, this results in any folder that contains a `.DS_Store` file being completely excluded from search results. If I fall back to v0.28.0, I get these results back.

As @danielnolan mentions in the above issue, removing the `*` from the `.DS_Store` reference fixes the behavior, but I'm not sure if that has other impact on Git or Ag that I'm missing. It also seems like it's a mismatch between that Git is ignoring and what Ag ignores.

For my use of ag, I'm never going to be interested in more than 1000 results.  As a matter of fact, I doubt I'd ever even look at anything with ~100 results.  Sometimes searches will take a very long time and return hundreds of thousands of results, whereas I would have been happy with just seeing the first 100 results which would be enough to tell me that this is not the search I wanted to do.

"
3625,Positive,"The loop detection should be definitely implemented. I've studied the problem a little and looked through `grep` source to learn how they do it. 
Their solution is the following: create a hash table and while entering each directory save the pair [device number and inode of the dir] as a value in the hash table (actually, it's a set as there are no explicit keys). After the directory is 'grepped', the entry is deleted from the hash table.
And if we enter the directory and there's already a corresponding entry in the hash table, then probably there are symlinks that form a loop (or directory hierarchy may be corrupted). 

Therefore, it would be awesome to add the similar feature to `ag`. 

I'm ready to dive into the problem and propose a working solution. But I have no desire to write a hash table from scratch. It would be great to use some small and fast implementation. I haven't chosen any yet, also I'm not good at licensing stuff. 

Your suggestions are welcome.

3627,Negative,"When using Silver Searcher with the invert match flag (-v) you get back all of the lines that contain text not matching the pattern searched for.  In both grep and ack, using invert match gives you back all of the lines that do not contain the pattern searched for. For example, if you start with a file containing the lines:

```
thing one
thing two
```

If you search this file using `ag -v one` you get back:

```
thing one
thing two
```

If you do either `grep -v one` or `ack -v one` you get back:

```
thing two
```

The behavior of ack and grep seems much more useful.  I'm not sure why you would want the current Silver Searcher behavior (although maybe this is just due to lack of imagination).  I think Silver Searcher should match ack and grep.  

Thoughts? I might try to right a patch for this if there is agreement that this is what Silver Searcher should be doing.

3640,Neutral,"[EDIT] I found out that using `:lcd` instead of `:cd` leaves the quickfix paths intact (because it doesn't touch its cwd). So this isn't really needed for this scenario anymore.

`ag` can be used as `grepprg` in Vim, but the quickfix doesn't work well once the path is changed (using Vim's `cd`). Some plugins do this automatically (like vim-rooter), and after that the relative paths in the quickfix window aren't valid anymore.

This also happens when using the Ack.vim or Ag.vim plugins.

Would it be possible to add a command-line option so that `ag` outputs absolute file paths? Maybe either ""~/path/to/my/file.txt"" or ""/something/outside/the/user/directory.txt"", depending on where the file is?
"
3641,Neutral,"Sometimes, you don't want to exclude based on a _.*ignore_ file. You may just want to exclude certain patterns based on a one-time only search. For example:

`ag var --exclude-files={*.js, *.markdown}`

would exclude files based on those extensions.

On a directory level:

`ag var --exclude-dirs={lib, src}`

would not enter directories that match _lib_ or _src_.

For extra ice cream bonus points, wildcard matching would be awesome: `s*rc*` excludes _src_ and _source_.

```
~: ag -C 3 b

3-  <-- This is the phantom line
```

After some attempts of guess and verification, I figured out that this issue may be related to LF at last line. The phantom line disappeared if I stripped the LF.

I'm not sure this behavior is a feature or a bug of `ag`, but vim treats LF at last line as an end of line but not a start of new line, therefore it appends LF by default. This causes troubles when searching these files with `ag`.

In contrast, `ack` does not append phantom line with same file.

So, I download/attempt to build your project. Running Fedora x64 here.

I have a problem aclocal - I don't know why, but my aclocal installation is a bit grumpy, has to do with different versions of m4 files in different places with different versions (and a system and an Activestate perl being installed).

So, I run your build script, automake crashes and burns (aclocal specifically), and yes, I do have stuff in my /usr/local/share/aclocal/ folder, although it looks like its picking up stuff from just /usr/share.

I think ""hey, hum maybe my aclocal is wrong"", so I go to see what version I have. 1.13.4, according to yum.

3652,Neutral,"What about adding option (like '--no-numbers' ) to disable line numbers output?

For example, you want to search for something in the form of ""double ag"":
`$ ag <smth> | ag <smth2>`

But if 'smth2' is a number, it may collide with line numbers from first 'ag' output.
"
3653,Neutral,"Related to #400.

For use in scripting it would be helpful to be able to strip all output except the actual match. I know I can use `--nogroup -o` and then pipe the output through `cut` in order to extract the matches (first example has matches highlighted with brackets to show the structure):

```
~$ ag 'f\w+'
foo.txt
1:[foo] [foobar]
4:[foobar]

~$ ag --nogroup -o 'f\w+' | cut -d: -f4
foo
foobar
foobar
```

Still, I think it would be much prettier and less fragile if we could configure all parts of the output. Some parts are already there, for example the `--no-numbers` option, so only the file name remains:

```
~$ ag --nogroup --no-numbers -o 'f\w+' 
foo.txt:foo
foo.txt:foobar
foo.txt:foobar
```

I could imagine a `--nofilename` option that implies the ommission of file name, line and column numbers, i.e. only printing the match itself, nothing else.

```
~$ ag --nogroup --nofilename -o 'f\w+' 
foo
foobar
foobar
```

it should also work without `--nogroup`

```
~$ ag --nofilename -o 'f\w+' 
foo
foobar
foobar

``` vim
let g:ctrlp_user_command = 'ag %s -l --nocolor -g """"'
```

It's config for a Vim fuzzy finder where Ag is being used as a speedy means of populating a list of files to match on (the plugin interpolates a base directory at `%s`). I scratched my head for a minute wondering why that command even works.

Ack informatively bails:

``` sh
$ ack -l -g '' ./
Options '-l' and '-g' are mutually exclusive
```

Ag goes ahead anyway, seemingly just ignoring the `-l`, but as a user I can't really be sure, it may as well be undefined behavior:

``` sh
$ ag -l -g '' ./
app/admin/admin_users.rb
# -- SNIP --
```

Since it's not invalid to pass an option that implies content search, I wonder what happens if I try to pass a pattern for content matching?

``` sh
$ ag --column --nogroup -g '' ruby test.rb
ERR: Error stat()ing: ruby
ERR: Error opening directory ruby: No such file or directory
test.rb:1:1:#!/usr/bin/env ruby
test.rb:2:-19:
test.rb:3:-20:puts ""I'm a test script.""

This is a nonsense incantation since I'm trying to pass a pattern where a path is being expected, but the failure mode is poor. And look! It almost leads me to believe I can get the file name output when searching a single file that I requested in #361 :smile: 

By the way, it would be awesome if filetype support worked when using `-g` -- this does the right thing in ack:

``` sh
$ ack --ruby -g '' ./
```

With Ag the `--ruby` file scoping is seemingly ignored. This probably warrants a separate feature req for tracking, let me know if you'd entertain it if I filed one.

My C-fu is weak, but I'll try to pitch in some option validation if time allows. Just wanted to log this stuff when I encountered it.

This assumption turns out not to hold in all cases: https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher/blob/07f83361197593302d7af1e2bb1fa0a6ec8c646e/src/ignore.c#L379

I'm on OS X Yosemite, running the latest version of ag (I tried a bunch of older versions of ag as well, and the issue goes _way_ back).
Here is how to reproduce the bug on my machine (**you might need to run it a bunch of times since it's a memory issue, or it may not show up at all on your machine**):
1. `mkdir ~/testdir && touch ~/testdir/randomfile`
2. `git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global`
3. `echo ""#########################"" > ~/.gitignore_global`
4. `ag ~/testdir -l --nocolor --hidden -g . --debug`

Depending on the run, I get output like:

(looks correct):

```

```

specifically, `path_start` is pointing to garbage, it just happens to be a ""#\n\0"" left over from reading the gitignore into memory (notice that there are 25 ""#""s; if you increase it to 26, you see two ""##""s here, and so on, until you cross an 8 byte boundary or something (on my machine)).

Looking at the operation of `filename_filter`, in one instance, `base_path` is `/Users/anish/testdir` and `path` is `/Users/anish/testdir` (both null terminated). This violates the assumptions made in `ignore.c:379`: `base_path` does not always end in `/\0`. Then `base_path = path + 25`, and it points past the null character into some garbage.

This shouldn't be too hard to fix. If someone familiar with the code does it, it'll probably be faster. If nobody gets to it soon, I might take a look.
"
3661,Negative,"these command will work as expected:
`ag -s '(raise|Error)\b(?!(`|/))._`' ./`
`ag -s '(raise|Error)\b(?!(`|/))._`' ../../eksperimental/elixir`

but this command will ignore the entries in `.gitignore`
`ag -s '(raise|Error)\b(?!(`|/)).*`' /home/eksperimental/elixir/`

It's really bad because I was writing a bash script that would convert all provided paths to absolute.
any workaround?

I'm having trouble with those commands:

`ag --skip-vcs-ignores --ignore node_modules --ignore .git --ignore -g """"`
Skips all .gitignores and have to add all unwanted directories/files on my own.

3680,Neutral,"Hi @chipironcin 
Can you verify what attributes does the /dev/hpet have?
It should be a character device.
The test of st_mode of the stat structure in the_silver_searcher/src/search.c is a suspect.
It should discriminate against block devices and character devices."
3681,Neutral,"The `-w` option simply wraps your search pattern in `\b` (so `\.deliver` becomes `\b\.deliver\b')`. `\b` matches a word boundary, which is the 'space' between a word character (letters, numbers, and unders-cores) and a non-word character (anything that's not letters, numbers, and under-scores).

So `ag -w '\.deliver'` will never match something like `(self).deliver`, because the character to the left of the `.` is another non-word character (and therefore there is no word boundary).

This matches the behaviour of (e.g.) `pcregrep`, but it does not work like more traditional `grep`s like git or GNU, both of which use some custom boundary-matching code rather than rely on the equivalent boundary character class.

Ack also uses `\b`, but you might say it's 'smarter' about it than ag — it only adds the surrounding `\b` if the first/last character in the search pattern is a word character (so if it's `deliver` it will add `\b` to both sides, but if it's `\.deliver` it will only add it to the end). That seems like a neat way to do it to me, although how convenient it is in C (vs Ack's two lines of Perl), i don't know.

empty_match.t passes on an Ubuntu 16.04 system on an ext4 filesystem, but often fails on Ubuntu 16.10 and xfs.  Clearly we can't rely on the ordering of the file list.

I think to fix this we want to collect the output of `ag` into a temporary file, allowing so generate the expected output in 2 steps."

3709,Positive,"Stats is the best way to get this that I've found. Piping ag into `ag match | tr -d "" matches` is the simplest way I've come up with to get just the raw number if you need it in a script.

"
3710,Negative,"Ugh, that's my bad on that one. The issue that was fixed was that you couldn't ignore `*.min.js` files, because it would just get the `.js`, which doesn't match any ignored extension.

And then enable use of Ag for finding in file trees with:

``` lisp
(setq-default grep-first-column 1)

Now I get super-fast search results, with columnar precision.  A definite improvement, in several ways!
"
3712,Neutral,"The same thing happens when there is a directory structure deeper than the default value of 25:

ERR: Skipping ./pccsstorefront/web/grunt/node_modules/grunt-contrib-imagemin/node_modules/imagemin/node_modules/imagemin-jpegtran/node_modules/jpegtran-bin/node_modules/bin-wrapper/node_modules/download/node_modules/gulp-decompress/node_
modules/decompress/node_modules/decompress-tarbz2/node_modules/tar-stream/node_modules/readable-stream/node_modules. Use the --depth option to search deeper.

ag did not obey to .gitignore, but the workaround of putting an .agignore in the folder from where I was performing the search solved the issue.
"
3713,Positive,"`ag` doesn't rely on any existing binaries on the system, such as `hg` or `git`. Using something like `hg config ui.ignore` would require that to be installed.

Assuming `hg` is installed, we could run `hg locate` in mercurial directories to get 100% accurate ignores. We wouldn't need special logic for parsing `.hgignore` files or applying their ignores.

But, there are a handful of downsides to relying on `hg`:
- If `hg` is not installed, how do we get our ignores? Do we forget about them and search every file?
- If `hg` is installed but the repo is in some broken / strange state, `ag` will crash
- If `hg locate` is slow, `ag` will be slow
- Is `hg` now a dependency of `ag` in apt / brew / macports / yum / packman?

tl;dr - `hg config ui.ignore` is not going to happen

But an OK solution would be to blindly assume the global ignore would be located at `~/.hgignore`. I bet this guess will be correct for 95% of global ignores, which is a lot better than the 0% we're getting right now.
"
3714,Negative,"Unfortunately, ag is popular enough that if even 1% of users use PCRE-only regexes, I'll end up with 100+ angry people emailing me.

I knew about other regex libraries when I created ag, and I went with PCRE because it offered the best compromise of features, usability, performance. Like ICgrep, RE2 is not as nearly as powerful as PCRE. Just look at the swaths of NOT SUPPORTED on https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax. Simple functionality is missing (such as repeat character counts). Also, ag wasn't architected to have easily-swappable regex libraries. It is tightly coupled to PCRE, and looking at the codebase would make this pretty clear. 

I'm sorry if I'm coming across as callous, but your suggestion is comparable to going on the LKML and saying, ""Why don't you support FreeBSD jails instead of cgroups?""
"
3715,Positive,"That works, thanks!
"
3716,Negative,"No, I haven't addressed the speed issue.  In the long run I would like to build an index over the code that can be kept in-memory and use Facebook's watchman to keep it up-to-date, to avoid any traversals over the filesystem, but that is a much bigger task that I haven't had time for yet.
"
3717,Negative,"I can replicate this on NTFS.

I've run a git bisect and the error is introduced in commit cd149d2730988dec43fa0f5238b263b7d98af38b. Don't have time to look at this any further this evening, I'm afraid.
"
3718,Neutral,"I think @bentomas is asking about installing deps on OS X without brew. You could grab tarballs for the dependencies and install them, but I'm not sure why you'd want to. Homebrew makes life much easier.

3719,Neutral,"Try it out with master. `ag --pager ""less -R"" blah` should work.
"
3720,Neutral,"What operating system are you on? I've followed your instructions, but I can't get anything to hang on Ubuntu 14.10 or OS X 10.10. I've tried ag 0.27 and master. Both print out a ton of results, but nothing bad happens.

3724,Neutral,well there must be a default ignore configuration because ag does not search in node_modules for instance. this can be closed

3726,Neutral,"I needed to add `--no-color` as `ag` writes colours through pipes otherwise, and this was preventing the subsequent `ag` matching properly.

```
ag -l --no-color one | xargs ag -l --no-color four | xargs ag --filename 'one|four'
```

Bug #1164 prevents printing the filename if only one filename is passed to the final `ag`."
3727,Neutral,"It seems that the procfs does not support the mmap operation. The only operations supported are the ones defines in the structure [proc_mem_operations](http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/fs/proc/base.c#L794).
A possible fix would be to check the errno set by mmap after it fails (which is ENODEV for devices that do not support mmap) and fallback to reading into a buffer.
"
3728,Neutral,"If those fail, ag should just crash or something.
"
3729,Neutral,"Well. if I want to skip `pdf` `doc` `jpg` `png` `out` `exe` etc, does it means I need to append more and more `--ignore` options? I hope `--ignore` can support regex, then I can do that gracefully, i.e. `--ignore ""(pdf|doc|jpg|png|out|exe|)$""`.

3747,Neutral,"Confirmed. Looks like the method filename_ignore_search() only takes the filename portion as a param and not the full (relative?) path as well. Updated my test repo. 
"
3748,Neutral,"One reason why this behavior would be useful is that often, one is using the silver searcher to look through a project that contains minified js alongside readable code. The user would prefer to omit the terminal-filling block of unreadable js from the results so they can focus on the readable code alongside it.

"
3756,Positive,"Very good idea, everyone is moving away from the root of the home directory, `.config` being the desired location.

3761,Negative,"The `.agignore` in each person's home directory is shared?! I'm sure there must be a misunderstanding.
"
3762,Neutral,"There isn't, and doing so would require extensive changes and ruin ag's performance. It would have to wait until the entire search was finished before it could print out any results. You should probably use `find` for these sorts of searches.
"
3763,Neutral,"Resurrecting this thread.

This is a fundamental issue with modifying mmapped files while they're being read. If you can think of any solutions, I'd love to hear them. I wrote a few of my own, but I don't want to influence yours. Please take a couple minutes to think of solutions before reading any farther.

...

...

...

My ideas:
1. Locking every file. This seems inefficient. _Every_ file has to be locked while it's searched, and every file with a match has to be locked until the matches are printed out. This also might require write permissions on the files being searched, or cause searching to hang while waiting for a file lock. I'm pretty sure most filesystems and OSes require write permissions to exclusively lock a file.
2. Adding a --no-mmap option. I'm not sure how useful this would be. I think most people who see a segfault would say, ""This program sucks."" and stop using it.
3. Default to reading files into buffers and add a --mmap option. This increases memory usage and hurts performance.

That's what I've thought of after a couple minutes. I'm split between option 2 and doing nothing. I welcome other ideas.
"
3764,Negative,"Do _any_ regex patterns work for you guys? It's as if you've built against a different version of libpcre than the one that's getting loaded at runtime.

Also, @Mandar12: Please mention what operating system you're using, your version of ag, pcre, etc. If I can't reproduce the problem, I can't fix it.
"
3765,Neutral,"It works fine for me : 

```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/tst-git
$ echo '*.map' > .gitignore
$ echo ""foobar"" > myfile.map
$ ag foobar # returns nothing
$ rm .gitignore
$ ag foobar
myfile.map
1:foobar
```

It also works with deeply nested paths, eg by doing after the echo '*.map' > .gitignore : 

```
mkdir -p deep/nested/path/for/testing
echo ""foobar"" > deep/nested/path/for/testing/foo.map
```

Are you using the latest ag version 0.30 ?
"
3766,Positive,Fixed in #957. Thanks!
3767,Positive,"Thanks for your work, looks great!
"
3768,Neutral,"It's working a while ago, BTW.
You can just do this:

 sudo chown $(whoami):admin /usr/local
- you might also use the ""-R"" flag.

because before most of the file there used to owned by the: ""wheel"" group. or some by the root user as I remeber...

You can do the same with some other files or directories in the home dir. like rubies...

That's all, I  think.
"
3769,Neutral,"I see there was an update the the freeBSD ports on 15 November, 2014 but its not because of this change. Can you ensure you update it in ports:

Having the same problem, I've just done another port of ag for Windows that can find non-ASCII characters... But so far only in text files encoded as UTF-8.

3800,Neutral,"This issue, I think, can be closed now that a Wiki has been added for [Windows](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher/wiki/Windows).

"
3801,Neutral,"The actual format isn't really important to me.  Instead of a separate file it could be something like using `!` in front of a line in .agignore.  For example:

```
$ cat .agignore

The general idea is the same though -- instead of only having a way to modify the ignore set for ag by adding to it, ideally there'd be a way to modify it by removing as well.

```
off_t f_len = 0;
size_t bytes_read = read(fd, buf, f_len);
if ((off_t)bytes_read != f_len) {
    die(""expected to read %u bytes but read %u"", f_len, bytes_read);

That's certainly fair. I wish I could be of more help with implementing a feature like this, but it's been a _long_ time since I last flexed by `C` muscles.

Have a great holiday!
"
3830,Neutral,"Feel free to correct me if any of this information is false.

1) The -g flag just limits the search to file names. What is the contents of your .agignore? It seems to have the behavior I expect when trying to replicate.

2) Where is your .agignore file located at? When running:

`ag pattern dir`

It looks like it is searching for an .agignore file in the user's directory and one in the defined directory within the command. Are you expecting it to search within the current directory you are in? Is this the expected behavior @ggreer ? Maybe it should also look within the current operating directory.

3) When using the --ignore flag, you are explicitly telling it where your file is. Without, it will look for the ones mentioned above.

3843,Neutral,"@danielbayerlein Launchpad is available for me. You find the debs [here](http://ppa.launchpad.net/pgolm/the-silver-searcher/ubuntu/pool/main/t/the-silver-searcher/). But I don't build packages at the moment. If you are on Ubuntu 13.10 you should use the package from [universe](http://packages.ubuntu.com/saucy/silversearcher-ag).
"
3844,Negative,"Your benchmark has several issues.
1. Did you build the Android source or is this a clean checkout? A decent chunk of ag's speed often comes from ignoring giant binary files that people accidentally search with `grep`.
2. Your search is returning tens of thousands of results, which is unrealistic for normal usage. Typically, people are looking for dozens of results at most. This is why ag's printing code isn't optimized at all. If there are a ton of results, printing is likely to be the bottleneck.
3. Grep isn't printing out line numbers. Ag prints line numbers by default, which is an expensive operation. Still, line numbers are very useful when searching code.
4. Grep's results can be interspersed, while ag's are segregated by file.
5. It looks like you're only searching `.java` files. This obviates the need for most of ag's ignore features (and most of your `-prune` options to `find`). Ag is meant to be fast by default, even when you don't know what files you want to search. `ag android` takes zero mental effort and runs pretty quickly, considering the size of the directory.

I realize it would take a long time fully address every one of these issues, so don't feel obliged to reply to every one. I'm just pointing out ways in which your benchmark is unrealistic. Ag is fast, but it is not optimized solely for speed.

One last thing: How did the relative difference in performance change on a machine with fewer CPUs?
"
3845,Positive,"Thanks for the solution, ZyX-I.
"
3846,Negative,"Same problem here. I've switched to [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep). It's inspired by the Silver Searcher. It handles parent & nested ignore files correctly. This is great for searching across multiple projects in the same folder. Also for descending (or not) into node_modules, like in @justinaray's case."

3849,Negative,I'm hit by this limitation today to grep my 7GB mailbox. It would be really great to handle large files.
3850,Negative,"Sorry, but that's pretty hard to build. Correctly doing this would require language detection and actual parsing of each language. It sounds like exuberant ctags is the tool you want.
"
3851,Negative,"The inability the define new file types in file search tooling, and therefore requiring a parallel but different set of aliases is definitely sub-optimal.
As an example with ack, one of the almost 100 patterns I have is this:
`--type-add=deb-maint:is:preinst,postinst,prerm,postrm
`
and sure, I could add an alias for that, but now I have to remember an alias for util 'a' and a file type name for tool 'b'. This doubles the amount of extraneous crap I need to keep in my ever shrinking head.
If ag could be configured to use the same mappings, even if non-DRY on the config, the ability to use either utility and not have to remember 2 completely different set of file selection mnemonics would be big help.
"
3852,Neutral,"Just wanted to confirm.  After running `make menuconfig` and `make`, grep appears to be slightly slower than ag with literals (again, ran multiple times, following are the median results)

```
$ make menuconfig
$ make
$ time grep -r intel1 . | wc -l
21
real    0m1.009s
user    0m0.543s
sys     0m0.453s
$ time ag intel1 | wc -l
21
real    0m0.904s
user    0m0.917s
sys     0m0.640s
```

And if you add regex into the mix, ag is noticeably faster:

```
$ time grep -r ""intel[0-9]"" . | wc -l
493
real    0m2.603s
user    0m2.093s
sys     0m0.493s
$ time ag ""intel[0-9]"" | wc -l
493

"
3855,Negative,"Actualy my problem is little bit complicated..
I usualy write my code in Geany IDE on remote folder mounted localy via ssh. Search (grep) is very slow on such mounted folders and big projects, so I think that would be nice to call command on remote system and get its results.
And I'm trying to add ag as a default search engine for Geany IDE. Its possible to change default ""grep"" to something else in Geany. So I changed grep to my perl script which execute ""ssh v3 'ag params'"" . I parse geany ""grep"" params and translate it for ag usage.
Ok, that works with ""--vimgrep"". But I wanted more. For example I want to use ""reverse result or --invert-match"" - standart search function. But it works wrong with --vimgrep. I decided not to use --vimgrep. But I need filename in result. **ssh -t** can give me that. But I cant use **ssh -t** with geany couse its fails with **""Pseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal""** now ))

3856,Positive,"@ggreer again, thanks for your quick reaction, really appreciated!
"
3857,Negative,"I know the issue is already closed, but the main problem with PCRE is that it displays exponential behavior even in regexes without backreferences (the only feature that absolutely requires an exponential algorithm, and makes [regex matching NP-complete](http://perl.plover.com/NPC/NPC-3SAT.html)). The Russ Cox's material linked by @maxnordlund has a clear example that creates an odd behavior in ag.

``` bash
$ printf 'a%.0s' {1..100} > somefile
$ ag '(a?a){100}' somefile
```

The example above does respond quickly, but it seems to do so via some sort of timeout, yielding no results (even having one obvious match). Changing all `100` in the example to `10` yields normal results.

In addition to being regex syntax. square brackets are shell glob patterns so if a file named `tmux` existed in your PWD, the shell would ""expand"" the glob to match the file. If there's no match, the brackets will probably get passed on to the args of the command you're running.

In addition, the zipfile comment and individual file comments (if any) are displayed. If a file was archived from a single-case file system (for example, the old MS-DOS FAT file system) and the -L option was given, the filename is converted to lowercase and is prefixed with a caret (^).

pieces and the problem no longer occurs.

So, this problem is dependent on file size, and maybe
also the amount of available RAM and swap. I'm using
a 2GB RAM + 2GB swap virtualbox VM to run this test.

I'm guessing that you'd see this problem if you

{""result"":""error"", ""message"":""You are requesting a precise subTable but there is not such data in the Archive.""}

which is better, but.

So I assume that this is a bug in the current version, since date range should as well be available when using idSubtable.

Best regards,

We announced this in a blog post few months ago: https://piwik.org/blog/2014/10/announcing-piwik-will-end-php-5-3-support-six-months-may-2015/

Notes
- Update [requirements](http://piwik.org/docs/requirements/)
- Update api.piwik.org/1.0/getLatestVersion/ to return 3.0.0 only when PHP >= 5.4.0
- Change CI build and remove PHP 5.3 builds
- maybe some part of codebase can be simplified in case we were doing custom logic for PHP 5.3

3915,Negative,"As reported in https://twitter.com/innerlambada/status/452858535198867457 the installer fails when php5-json isnt installed. The JSON library uses a non-free license (should be used for good, not evil) and is therefore not installed by default on debian-esque systems - we should make sure that JSON is available and properly error out if it is not. 

This is a bit tricky since we cant load translations when JSON isnt available..

1. I am conducting a Site Search (Wordpress page to be exact) and search page gives me few results.
2. I click each one of them to be opened in new browser tab.
3. Only the first one will be displayed in ""Pages following a Site Search"" report.

I believe this is due to the synchronous tracking of the pages following each other which is vividly visible in visitors log - for sure the only 1st opened site is ""following a Site Search"" but still, the other actions tracked should also be tracked as sites which were opened from a Site Search.

Is there some opportunity to improve this situation? Both on the field of displaying data in Visitor Log and ""Pages following a Site Search"" report.

"
3920,Positive,"**ALPHA version currently**

Current Piwik contains a disabled-by-default plugin called Live! that, when enabled, add a new widget in the widget list, that will show your latest visitors in real time. However this plugin is not very useful as such, and was built as a proof of concept. Improving the plugin has been one of the most requested user feature for months! If you would like to help, please post a comment, or submit a patch. Enjoy

**Concept**

The page should be entertaining to watch, fed with real time data, and open the webmaster to dig more into the other reports that Piwik offer. 

**Background**
This feature is heavily requested by the community (http://feedback.phpmyvisites.net/feedbacks/2630-last-n-visitor-details-config-info-path-etc) and would be really providing a plus to Piwik feature set.

**Data provided**
- at top of screen, clear summary:
  - Today you had: N visits, M pages today
  - In the last 30 minutes you had: X visits, Y pages
- list of the last N visitors with their information 
  - settings (os, browser, resolution, plugins) - icons only, details on icon hover 
  - referer (keyword, name, icon, clickable url - useful for SEO)
  - country icon
  - IP for piwik users with admin permission or super user
  - count of pages seen during this visit
  - time spent during this visit
  - number of goals converted, click on goals would show the list of pages with goals highlighted (see below)
- for each visit, it is possible to view pages: 
  - page title, 
  - page url that links to it, 
  - outlinks are shown different colors (icon ?)
  - downloads are shown different colors (icon ?)
  - when the page view was a Goal trigger, different color (icon ?) along with goal name and revenue.

**UI features**
- this page should make it possible to view all past visits for a current returning visitor. The idea would be to have an icon when the visitor is a returning visitor. Clicking on this icon would show the past visits for this visit. This is a UI challenge to make it look good and make it usable. for examples, previous visits rows could be shown below the visit row with a left margin and below a title ""This visitor previously visited the website:"". 
- by default, the spy mode would be enabled, therefore the page would reload regularly (every 2 seconds?) and show the new visits. We need a way to pause/resume the spy mode, if traffic is too big or if user wants to take more time to analyze existing traffic snapshot
- all the data would be shown in a one page interface, to simplify browsing and discovery; this poses UI challenges to make the page usable and looking clean.
- all data would be provided through the Live! plugin API. 
- there is an open question on how to refresh visits for which visitors view a new page. For example, we could highlight the visit row in yellow background and add the new page row below the visit. Or we could automatically move the visit with the new page view at the top of the page and highlight (eg. yellow background) the new page view.

**in V2**
- on the right of the spy, or on a different ""spy page"", we could show a auto-refreshing google map with the new visits in real time. see #5466

Any feedback? Anybody would like to help implementing this  interesting new plugin and UI challenge?

3935,Neutral,"I just noticed that piwik doesn't track downloads of OVA files. It would be good to add custom download files to a configuration file.
"
3936,Neutral,"This RFC is about discussing changes in the configuration system.

Current status is a mix of:
- INI files
- Configuration values in code
- Objects created in the code

Currently too many things are configured at runtime instead of in a configuration file. For example some things are configured through events. By separating configuration and execution, we end up with a more explicit config and simpler code (ridden of configuration). And we offer more extension points since plugins can override everything in the config (not that they always should ;) ).

Changes proposed:
- move config options from INI files to DI config
- move configuration logic (that is in the code) to DI config
- move objects creation to DI config (or factory objects called by DI config)
- plugins can provide an optional config file (e.g. named `config/config.php`?)

List of DI configuration files and their order of inclusion:
- `config/main.php`
- `plugins/.../config/config.php` (Plugins configs)
- `config/environment.dev.php`
- `config/environment.test.php`
- `config/config.php` (User config)

Environment config allows to override default config and to avoid doing so dynamically it in the code.
#### Example

When configured to log to file, the logger reads the file name from the `Config` object.

Then it gets the `tmp` path and append the filename to it.

Then it gets the Piwik Instance ID and appends it to the path (if not null), which is a special case for the `CloudAdmin` plugin.

This could be replaced by a config looking like this (this is an abstract config syntax for simplicity):
- default config:
  - `tmpPath = PIWIK_ROOT . '/tmp'`
  - `logFile = tmpPath . '/logs/piwik.log'`

This covers the most common cases. Then if a plugin (e.g. CloudAdmin) wants to customize the path:
- `CloudAdmin` config:
  - `tmpPath = tmpPath . '/' . instanceId` (replace the default config value)
- User config:
  - `instanceId = 123`

In the end, we end up with the same result except configuration is separated from execution (the file is not configured in code). The config is more explicit, and also more extensible. No need to add custom ""instance ID"" code in Piwik Core just for a feature of the CloudAdmin plugin.
#### Do we keep INI files?

2 things:
- global/internal Piwik config
- user config

Global config should be moved to DI config because it's much more powerful so I don't see the point to maintain 2 separated configs.

However user config can be changed by users (obviously) so it might be best if it's as simple as possible (PHP syntax might be too much).

I think DI config files is not incompatible with being simple. If we stick to INI, we'll seriously limit what users can do and override. With DI config they have much more power, yet we can still provide simple configuration options on a use case basis (i.e. no complex PHP syntax).

Quick and **dirty** example with the logger:

``` php
// User config
return [
    'logger' => 'file' // or ""stdout"" or ""database""
];

// Global config
return [
    'Psr\Logger\LoggerInterface' => DI\factory(function ($container) {
        $choice = $container->get('logger');

        if ($choice === 'file') {
            // ...
        } else // ...
    }),
];
```

Then it still leaves the possibility to advanced users (e.g. Piwik Pro Cloud) to override `Psr\Logger\LoggerInterface` in their user config to something completely different.

By the way this is how Symfony works with Bundle: you can set up objects manually (e.g. set up your logger and all) or use a bundle that will abstract and simplify the config for you so that you just have to set 1 or 2 options.

3951,Neutral,"A lot of links are still on http. Many of them get 301-redirected to https. Which is good: The 301-redirect should remain, to not break existing links somewhere in the wild.

But on web pages hosted by piwik, piwik should migrate the links to https, so that users get to the https version without being 301-redirected.

Reason:

- **Security:** 301-redirects are requests which are requested and responded via http. Which is unencrypted, and more important, not safe against manipulation and  not authenticating the server. E.g. MITM can manipulate the target URL to something phishy.

- **Performance:** Reducing the number of 301-redirects which are actually _executed_ every day improves the performance of a web page (saves a round trip for each and every 301 redirect). Performance is not the main point for me, just nice to have.

Now that piwik already 301-redirects most of its http links to https, a link checker can be taken to analyze all these 301-redirects and fix them to https where possible. That should work for all links to https-only web sites (including external links like e.g. links to twitter).

Additionally it should be possible to run a function directly after the configuration is read (before database initialization) so that the database setting can be directly obtained from other projects settings, without writing it into the piwik configuration file.
All this will make it very easy to integrate piwik into other projects.

4000,Negative,"I was just working on an additional update file to remove no longer needed files to remove those files:

```
'misc/others/test_cookies_GenerateHundredsWebsitesAndVisits.php',

'core/Tracker/ActionEvent.php',
'plugins/Actions/Widgets.php',
'plugins/CustomVariables/Menu.php',

'plugins/UserCountry/Widgets.php',
'plugins/UserSettings/Widgets.php',
'plugins/VisitTime/Widgets.php',
'plugins/VisitorInterest/Widgets.php'
```

Problem is the following: Those files might be added in a future version of Piwik again. Imagine we add a `plugins/VisitorInterest/Widgets.php` file to Piwik in 2.6.0 and a user updates from 2.4.0 to 2.6.0.

What will happen is that `plugins/VisitorInterest/Widgets.php` will be copied to the users Piwik installation but afterwards removed by an update in 2.5.0 although the file should not be removed. So this solution does not really work either. Maybe we could check the age of the file that is supposed to be deleted and then decide whether to delete or not but even this might not work in all cases (eg if Update executed later etc)

The only solution that seems to work for me is by comparing the new Piwik version with the current Piwik version of the user and remove no longer needed files as explained and implemented above. But users will have to update at least twice until it works (see above). 

I just tested an update from 2.4.0 to 2.5.0-b2 and those Widget files above still exist but it is not that much of a problem as same widgets that are added multiple times are only shown once. They are defined in Reports and Widgets now because Widgets are not removed. This can be a problem in the future once the widgets are defined differently in Reports and Widgets class. Same for Menu. 

Any further ideas? Or is solution maybe ok for now?

4005,Neutral,"> by how much using Piwk affects the performance of a website

There is no such single answer. It depends on many things. Like how you embed Piwik, how fast your server is, where your audience is located, whether you server the piwik.js eg via CDN, whether you have proper caching in place for piwik.js and gzip, whether you load it from same domain or different one, how ""big"" your website is in terms of files that need to be loaded and size etc. Also it depends on how you define ""performance"". Do you mean page load time? page ready time? Do you mean fps when scrolling or doing something on the website etc.

In general there should be once a request to piwik.js and then it should be cached. It is only a few kb and should be fast yet still user needs to load it. If performance is super important, I'd recommend to have a look and embed it eg like this after page load (with the risk of missing some visitors to be tracked): https://github.com/piwik/piwik/issues/9077 

Then there is usually one request eg. per pageview which is like only a few bytes and depending on your server can take anything between 4ms and like 500ms. This is in the background though and user shouldn't notice it. Also doesn't use much on the network as said only few bytes.

If you use premium features like Media Analytics or Form Analytics there might be more requests while a user watches a video or uses a form but they all have small footprints.

Another thing that may affect performance is when clicking on an outlink (to different website) and Piwik tracks it, then we may delay the opening on the other website by like 300ms or 500ms to make sure the tracking request to measure the outlink is sent.

Exactly, there is no guarantee that having code reviewed will make it bug-less (if one developer can miss a bug, then 2 or 3 could too). Code review should not be relied upon to detect bugs, that's the role of automated tests (which are far less expensive in that regard).

IMO code reviews are mostly useful to discuss anything that has a significant impact on other developers and the project:
- big features, new plugins
- architectural changes
- changes to core components/important parts of Piwik
- large codestyle changes (to give an example of something that has a very ""soft"" impact)
- ask question/feedback on something in particular

For e.g. typo fixes or small bugfixes the cost of changing that later is minimal so I don't think it's worth blocking for days and take time off other people for reviewing.

4115,Neutral,"One more UX suggestion:
- when we start recording the full status of each view (exclude low pop, flatten, etc.) to restore the table as they were, I think it will be very important to highlight the fact that the table is currently flattened / or that low populations are excluded (or both).
  - when any option was clicked or initialized in the new menu (btw we need a name for it...), Could you please put the icon in yellow? I think this would at least help users understand a bit why the view is the way it is.
  - it would be also very nice if we could somehow display somewhere ""Report is flattened - un-flatten report"" or ""Rows with few visits are hidden - Show all rows"" so it is clear, just by reading the menu, what is the status of the report.

Thoughts?

 I still think we could opt-in and provide a opt-out in case it really poses problem for some users. That's because in this issue the scope is only for right clicks on Downloads and Outlinks which will be a very small part of all right clicks. eg. Users who right click to ""translate"" most of the time will right click anywhere in the window and likely not on a download link or outlink... Can you think of an actual use case where users would right click on outlinks/downloads and not want to open them in most cases?

4141,Negative,"> Loading data... could be instead ""Loading Evolution data for {here icon and label name}"" this could be done by copying the HTML of Label row, including the icons/logos? 

The problem is that we only have the label in the URL parameter. Since RE launched by changing the hash part of the URL, we don't have the data table row DOM el. What we have is the label - we could show that but it looks weird for subtables. E.g. when row evolution is openend on an outlink, it might look like ""www.example.com > /"".
We don't have the icon at all so there's no way to show it expept add it to the URL too which introduces XSS possibilities. We could only show it when RE has been launched from a table and pass the row dom el around but this would add complexity to the already complex code.

I use it to get the data for the past 12 months.

Steps to reproduce:
To get the data for the same month last year, I use this:
`module=API&method=API.get&format=CSV&idSite=37&period=month&date=last%20year`
To get the data for last month I use this:
`module=API&method=API.get&format=CSV&idSite=37&period=month&date=last%20month`
To get the data for all months from last year to last month I tried to use this:
`module=API&method=API.get&format=CSV&idSite=37&period=month&date=last%20year,last%20month`
But it fails.
When I use 
`module=API&method=API.get&format=CSV&idSite=37&period=month&date=2015-07-01,2016-06-01`
the data is available.

Another example is the following:
`module=API&method=API.get&format=CSV&idSite=37&period=day&date=previous6`
gets me the data of the previous 6 days splitted per day (excluding today)

One would think the API following call:  `module=API&method=API.get&format=CSV&idSite=37&period=week&date=previous6`
would return the data of the previous 6 weeks, splitted per week
and
`module=API&method=API.get&format=CSV&idSite=37&period=month&date=previous6`
would return the data of the previous 6 months, splitted by month.

"
4161,Neutral,"Matt: is that php 5.2.6?  (just making sure because pre-5.3 uses the compat functions).
"
4162,Neutral,"Well I have had recent visits from google.com.hk and google.com.ph which both used /imglanding after the domain. But they both had ""q="" and ""prev"" containing the search phrase. So ommitting a check for imglanding puts the keywords in a non google images count which is suspect.
When trying to reproduce it I get imgres but I'm using a UK IP so results may be different.

But importantly, anyone thinking they can change google searchengine name, without understanding how the code in common.php works, will find it just doesn't work because of the way its coded currently. Most users, I suspect, will just think they can change the search engines to whatever they like but the enforced default to ""Google Images"" is likely to be a mystery to them. I see no need to enforce that. If users then choose to change searchengine names they can.

I have now changed my code and it seems to be working. It works on the principle that if the domain contains google, then it checks for /imgres and if found it does its stuff. But also within the original google check, checks for ""images"" in search engine name and if not found adds it to end of search engine name. 
So this works for both the current standard setup but also works for anyone changing their search engine names for google (I think).

original code in common.php:

```

        if($searchEngineName == 'Google Images'
            || ($searchEngineName == 'Google' && strpos($refererUrl, '/imgres') !== false) )
        {
            $query = urldecode(trim(strtolower(self::getParameterFromQueryString($query, 'prev'))));
            $query = str_replace('&', '&amp;', strstr($query, '?'));
            $searchEngineName = 'Google Images';
        }
```

my new code:

```
  if ( strpos(strtolower($searchEngineName), 'google') !== false && strpos($refererUrl, '/imgres') !== false ) 
        {
            $query = urldecode(trim(strtolower(self::getParameterFromQueryString($query, 'prev'))));
            $query = str_replace('&', '&amp;', strstr($query, '?'));
            if ( strpos(strtolower($searchEngineName), 'images') === false )
   {
             $searchEngineName = $searchEngineName . ' Images';
            }   
        }
```

I have also changed my search engine names but that is another matter.

p.s. you now have my email address.

I just thought it would provide flexibility for those wanting to change their google searchengine names to split by country. The default names can remain as now but users don't have to worry about code not working if they do decide to change them.

4179,Negative,"The piwik database can't handle more than 4.294.967.295 loglines in total due to the fact that numeric fields are integers. And that number is the max. I have hit now for the second time, and the complete Piwik setup is useless. The reports now show that there are no page views anymore. So there are no updates anymore, and everything stays zero.

Please consider the change all numeric fields to either bit integers or longs. So that the limit is theoretically 18.446.744.073.709.551.615 loglines.

I am doing about 10.000.000 loglines a day, and with that amount, it will take me about 430 days to hit the max. That is almost 1,5 year. It cannot be that I have to delete the complete Piwik install every 1,5 year. With bigint the period will be 1.844.674.400.000 days.

The solution of making backup, dropping table and create it again, is not handy. Because you will lose the option to regenerate the reports, due to missing hits.
Changing to Bigint looks better. See the numbers in this post.

I am now trying to change the fields to Bigint, in order to preserve my history. But it takes very long time with 800.000.000+ loglines in the table.

Also I am surprised that this is already known for two years, and still not fixed...

When saving a park by clicking 'Save' or by using the quick save hotkey, custom scenery and rides are not exported with the saved game.

Test when loading a save that has been saved using Ctrl+F10 (quick save), and uses CD that I removed before loading the saved game:

> INFO[src\object_list.c:402 (object_list_cache_load)]: **1 object removed... updating object list cache**
> ERROR[src\object.c:172 (object_load_chunk)]: **object not installed**
> ERROR[src\object_list.c:565 (object_read_and_load_entries)]: **failed to load entry: RMCT1**

Same test - loading park with CS I don't own anymore - but was saved using 'Save as' from the menu:

> INFO[src\object_list.c:404 (object_list_cache_load)]: **1 object added... updating object list cache**

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Have the option for exporting plug-in data in saved games enabled
2. Open and park, and add a new scenery entry to it using the object selection
3. Quicksave the park
4. Quit the game, remove the custom scenery file
5. Run the game again - the cache will update

Player name can't be duplicated in normal ways if player is registed to server(it will became `Player #2`) but this can be bypassed by adding space to end of player's name. this can be confusing since there's no way to distinguish `""Player""` and `""Player ""`.

trailing whitespace should removed by client and server so there won't be any confusion.

4207,Positive,"Since having employees in a Multiplayer park (and maintaining them) desyncs the game between the server and the client a lot (like when/after setting patrols) I see a lot of hosts choosing to remove employees altogether and disabling functions that employees would normally do through the cheats, namely Vandalism and Littering. However, there is another important function that an employee does (the handyman, specifically): **watering plants**. 

I'd like to request a feature to toggle the need to water plants. It's also a good feature to have when you want to make flowers at locations a handyman can't reach, but you want them to look perfect forever nonetheless instead of clicking the cheat ""Water Plants"" every once in a while.

"
4223,Neutral,"Hee guys, (sorry for typos english isn't my native language)

I know its not the time to really get into this part of production yet, but since i cannot contribute to the current stage (I dont have any experience in programing) and really want to participate because I really like what you guys are doing. I came up with the following:

Awards:
In RCT2 you could win awards for being the best in this or that. Though its a cool feature it didn't really gave you anything. Let's say you win the award for safest park in the country. Would it be cool to earn a discount on new mechanics or earn a free month of wages. At least something that will benefit you. For every award you get you can think of something nice to give. This could add a lot of fun to the game.

Fanatic groups of peeps:
In real life there are people that travel around the world in groups to find the most badass rollercoasters to ride in them. Now I thought that mayby it would be cool if you constructed a rollercoaster with a excitement rating over a 9 or so that a group of people would enter your park (all dressed the same!) and go straight for your badass rollercoaster. You can implement this same principle for all sorts of attractions. like go karts or ride in a car. 

Mountain tool:
In one of the rtc1 additions there where some mountain tool options that where not included in rct2 because rct2 had the options of building scenery. But if I remember it correctly you could give the side of a hill the colour yellow and red and these also changed the apperance of an attraction going in the side of a mountian. They where round instead of square. Could you guys bring this back?

Eye dropper:
For example: you brought down a piece of land, now scenery on top of it gets deleted. (This has to disapear btw) it is very annoying to search for one or two scenery objects to replace it. An eye drop option would make this much, much easier and would speed up a building process in general.

Handyman:
Handymans could use some updates as well. How they orientate their selves around paths and towards litter. Besides that they should be able to fix vandelism. I know you guys already have some cheats to help this, but i mean actually seeing a handyman fix a bench. I can also remember a feature that chis saywer had in the original plans for rtc. And that was a handyman taking a lunch break. There's a change there might be something left in de game that shows this. How cool would it be to add this.

Tour guide:
An additional employee that walks around and accumulates peeps that will bring a buch of people from one place to another and in the mean time stops and pretends it is giving some information. This will bring the happiness up. This could also be implemented as an attraction maybe.

Mobile salesman.
An additional employee that walks around and sells for example balloons, souvenirs or icecream.

Medic:
An additional employee. There are benches and emergency posts for peeps to go to. To lower there nausia. But they will only do so when there nausia has reached a certain point. These workers will reduce lets say 20-25% percent of nausia when he/she is helping a peep. They help peeps that have a nausia rating higher than 10%.

Original peep codes:
Some cheat codes that where put in the game made some of the guests do some unique stuff. Like taking photographs and making paintings. There might be some cool ways to implement these features in the game without having them to activate threw cheat codes. The michael schumacher cheat code that let a person to drive really fast would be al cool option to use for a fanatic group of peeps when you have build a go karts attraction that has a high excitement rating. 

The amazing earl:
This guy had made alot of mods for rollercoaster tycoon 2. All of his creations look like they where made by chris saywer. The blend in perfectly. These could be used to expand the options of attractions. Here's a link: http://rct.wikia.com/wiki/The_Amazing_Earl 

Peeps:
I would like to see that peeps would enjoy the scenery more than they did originaly. By not alone giving them a bigger variety in thoughts about this. But also incorporate a game mechanic that lets a peep be picky in wich attraction he wants to go in based on the scenery that ride has to offer. There are no graphics for girls or for other races in the game. I dont know if you guys are planning to improve rtc up to that extant. but it would be awesome! If some of the peeps would prefer to walk in groups or lets say with there family that would be cool. A bigger variety in appearance. Like peeps having backpacks, already whearing glasses or applauding when there's a new ride available (only peeps that are close to the new ride)

Random events:
Planes flying over, personal messages from peeps that you follow, having peeps ask for the completion of a particular ride. fulfilling this need will boost some stats, accidents that can happen during rides that lowers happines, peeps finding money, peeps finding items raises their happines, peeps finding their solmates and stay together. 20% higher chance of this happening on the swans ride ( oehw,, romantic)
peeps sharing money or giving stuff, peeps saying funny stuff like: I think I left my oven on, at home. peeps that steal stuff which a guard can prevent, more wild life (fish, birds), peeps that request you to plant them somewhere else. A peep on drugs haha doing crazy stuff.
And many more you name it. All of this wil help to create a more dynamic wolrd.

Achievements:
All these achievements can be completed in the campaign or in a continuous park. They can only be completed one time.

have an excitement/intensity/nausia rating above 5, 10 and so on..
build 10, 20, 30 attractions
more than 5 rollercoasters
more than 10, 20, 30 staffmembers
placed an amount of ground/water
I could go on forever on this.. 

New attractions:
I know this would be alot of work to do properly but here's a list of attraction I thought off.

Indoor sky dive
Heli ride (actualy flyes around the park)
Plane ride (also really flyes, They could take off at the same airport)
Parachut drop with landing spot (on ground or on roofs)
Ferry ride
bus thats able to drive across footpaths.
Shooting stall
Water walkers (these big floating balls where you can climb into)
Game corner
Casino
Another type of cinema
Open theater
Slingshot
A play ground (with al kinds of different playground equipment, expandable)
minature railway with multiple platforms
paragliding
mazes with additional objects like a watch tower

Since there is a day and night cycle. Maybe it would be cool to add hotels and/or camping sites which alot of themeparks have. and restaurants. 

And additional things like fireworks, lighting, things to add on waiting lines (To ease the waiting), music boxes, custom music, scenery that benefits the experience of rides and coasters, a crossing point for footpaths and trains and so, having a clear and separete option to play a continuous game, a click and drag option for scenery no more single clicking fences please.

I can think of way more but I am done for it for now. Let me know if you guys think if there's some usefull stuff in this all. I've been busy on this for a whill now. I've one of you thought about something more let it be know in the comments.

4226,Neutral,"Raising a mountain with a one-tile-square selection costs $80.  Considering that nine tiles are affected, one might think the cost should be closer to $20*9 = $180, but Chris Sawyer's landscaping service offers a discount.  (If I recall correctly, this is consistent with RCT1.)

![1 tile mountain](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6338134/10714404/eb701bc6-7aab-11e5-8cfc-b64ff1b094cd.png)

With OpenRCT2, we can build mountains that have larger plateaus.  A mountain with a top two tiles square costs $320 to form.  Seeing as 16 tiles are affected, $20 \* 16 = $320 sounds like it's about the right price to pay.

![2 tile mountain](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6338134/10714414/249c9668-7aac-11e5-853d-addf639926f5.png)

By the time we reach a 3x3 mountain, the cost is $720.  25 tiles are affected, so we'd expect to pay closer to $20*25 = $500.  That said, some of the tiles would have taken two $20 operations to form, so it's about right regardless.

![3 tile mountain](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6338134/10714438/973d9848-7aac-11e5-977b-17b236ec456c.png)

A 4x4 mountain costs $1,280 to start, which is well above the $20 \* 36 = $720 we might expect to pay for it.  This is the turning point:  we could have built the same shape for less money using the standard tools.

![4 tile mountain](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6338134/10714441/bb0d9d04-7aac-11e5-8274-bff002bb9171.png)

It doesn't get better from here.  Starting a 64x64 mountain costs $327,680, which is way above the estimated $87,120.

It seems that the mountain tool is very naive in its pricing:  it simply multiplies the one-tile price by the number of tiles in the selection.  This isn't really the best way to go about it because it overcounts redundant land-moving operations.  I propose we change the pricing scheme to evaluate how much money it would cost if tiles were moved manually and use that value instead of the naive multiplication.

4230,Neutral,"This is a minor issue for me since it annoys me a little bit.

Throughout OpenRCT2, I think the original games RollerCoaster Tycoon and RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 should normally be written out if there is enough space and abbreviations should be avoided if possible (OpenRCT2 is not a forum or chat).
Also, drop the “1” in “RollerCoaster Tycoon 1” and “RCT1”, because the “1” is not part of the game name.
Instead of “RCT2”, use “RollerCoaster Tycoon 2” if you have the space.

It is okay to use the abbreviations “RCT” and “RCT2” for “RollerCoaster Tycoon” and “RollerCoaster Tycoon 2” if you are low on space or for development tools. In tooltips those names should generally be written in full.

Places where the game names appear:
- Names of title sequences
- Tooltip of the option which enables capital letters for ride banners
- Tooltip of title music selection in the options
- Default theme names
- Tooltip of option to sort rides by track type (it's okay to use “RCT” (not “RCT1”) in the option name itself)
- Tooltip of scenario sorting option
- Scenario of scenario unlocking
- Tooltip of handymen mow grass by default option
- Checkboxes in “Features” tab of theme editor (use “RCT” instead of “RCT1”, maybe add tooltips if you want to)
- Probably some other places I forgot, they might be found by searching for “RCT1” and “RCT2” and “RollerCoaster Tycoon 1”

I have a custom keyboard mapping configured, mapping my Caps Lock to trigger a Backspace instead (`setxkbmap -option caps:backspace && xmodmap -e ""clear Lock""`). However, this is not being registered by OpenRCT2, despite working fine in essentially every other game and application I use. The regular Backspace key works fine. 

The issue manifests throughout the game in all inputs I've tested. I don't have an original RCT2 installation set up (since I'm on Linux) and can't test it there.

When launching the headless server for the very first time, it does not store `users.json` which confuses users.

I'm trying to build OpenRCT (Lubuntu 16.04 x86), but CMake cannot find openssl>=1.0.0

This can be fixed just by installing libssl-dev, so I was thinking on editing the wiki to add this package to the `apt-get` command but, before doing so, I want to make sure I'm doing everything correct.

First, I called the `install.sh` script inside `scripts/linux` folder. Then, I installed all the packages listed in the [wiki](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/wiki/Building-OpenRCT2-on-Linux) following instructions under APT (Debian, Ubuntu) section.

And finally, executed the `build.sh` script inside `scripts/linux` folder, which gives me the error as you can see:

After wondering why guests were still complaining about disgusting paths despite hiring about 15 handymen, I looked around the park and saw that there was a huge group of them stuck in the entrance tile to one of my rides. This isn't the first time I've seen this behaviour, I also had a similar problem on a different scenario, though it has never happened to this big a group before.

I've made sure that the handymen are not set to patrol that one tile, and they aren't

4258,Neutral,"When you try to start a marketing campaign - for example: advertising campaign for the park - and try to adjust the length, the game crashes.
"
4259,Negative,"See title. In the original game, peeps could find the rides alright, heading for the queue entrance as they should. This gives a lot of problems, unsolvable without redoing entire park sections, when peeps are getting stuck in a corner somewhere because their AI changed from when the area was originally built. In general, this AI mechanic limits park composition a lot. I hope you can solve this soon, because it's the only thing in OpenRCT that ruins my fun occassionally. The other bugs are so minor I can live with them, and the beneifts of Open more than compensate for them. This one though... renders parks made before OpenRCT unusable.
"
4260,Neutral,"**OS:** Linux

The compiled binary for Linux x86-64 of OpenRCT2 takes a lot of space, ~40MiB unpacked for just the ELF binary. This is partially because we use `RelWithDebInfo` build type, which embeds debug symbols into the file itself. This is very useful when we need to do actual debugging, but in most cases it just takes space.

The DWARF debug information, among others, has two types of informations:
* code-to-source-line mappings
* variable tracking information

For user to be able to provide valuable stack traces (symbolicated, with line numbers), only the first part is needed\* and the variable tracking can be turned off with `-fno-var-tracking` GCC option and this results in 25% smaller binary (30MiB). Unfortunately, disabling it at compilation time makes debug symbols much less useful.

Instead, I would like to try removing it in a post-process step. It looks like variable tracking information is located in `.debug_loc` section and perhaps simply extracting it out from the binary and into separate symbol file would yield desired effect:
* having smaller distributed binaries
* not sacrificing value of debug information.

\* This is just my assumption for now, I still have to verify it."

@zsilencer  That might be but it doesn't make sense that I hear the merry go round even when it's not visible. What I hear in vanilla makes sense, what I hear in OpenRCT2 does not. Not that vanilla is always that great as you can sometimes hear very hard transitions in music but at least what you hear makes some sense.

4291,Neutral,"I will look into the problem soon.
"
4292,Negative,"I don't see how this is too hard to do though - since everything would be up (except prices, sadly those don't inflate at the same rate), and since inflation would make it easier for people to walk into the park, I would say that the dynamics become interesting in higher - number years as guests would walk in with more money in their pocket than you would think and loads of guests would also walk into your park.  Inflation might make it easier for the park entrance entry fee only parks a little easier while making the ride entry fee parks slightly harder (since the rides only have so much they can take in at a time).  This could balance the game just a little bit."
4293,Neutral,"Connected to #257.

![](http://puu.sh/d1mR7/6a05ba943c.png)
"
4294,Negative,"It has been suggested once before. It's not what I would call much-requested.

Anyway, there is a very good reason for it, which you already mentioned actually: most parks are closed in the winter months, as most roller coasters cannot operate properly when it's too cold, and maintenance work is carried out during those months. Of course, there are some exceptions, even in temperate climates like in The Netherlands.

However, it would complicate things beyond belief. An RCT year (8 months) takes about 90 minutes. It would either mean most of your rides will be closed for 45 minutes, or open and close every few minutes (a day takes about 20-40 seconds in RCT!) to take the weather in account. Of course, in areas where it's always warm enough, that wouldn't apply, but then it would mean that you end up with a seriously complicated game, with very inconsistent behaviour between climates.

In short, I am against this. It's far too complicating and doesn't improve gameplay - in fact, I would say it degrades gameplay for the reasons I mentioned above.
"
4295,Neutral,"Ok, here is my verdict:
- People leaving the park on a boat is not a bug, provided they can go back as well.
- We only fix obvious mistakes in scenarios. Widening a (perceived to be) poorly designed water channel goes far beyond that.
- Boats getting stuck and doing nothing intelligent to get moving _is_ a bug. But I consider that point to be a duplicate of https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/issues/866.

Because of this, I will close this issue."
4296,Positive,"Hmmm... I will look at a way to make this work properly.
"
4297,Neutral,"Closing this due to the OP not replying.
"
4298,Neutral,"I see, this happens only when using OpenGL
"
4299,Neutral,"It would require duplication of _all_ guest actions, not just those concerning rides. Also, English has looser capitalisation rules. In any way, it's jumping into conclusions that it's wrong.

As for other languages: I have solved it in Dutch (in which it wasn't not good grammar) by changing it to

```
Guests with status: Queueing for Jet Skis 1
```

Which would work with German as well. In any case I feel it's something for the native speakers to decide.
"
4300,Neutral,"Just to clarify: The assertion triggered in the group park and gave me no dump file. I got the crash+dump when doing the same steps in the track design manager. While they obviously crashed somewhere else in the code, I assumed it was the same error as the steps to reproduce it are more or less the same and the console window had the same output.
"
4301,Neutral,"http://www.mediafire.com/file/q0kxn6xq78ta1g4/openrct2.DMP

here it is.
"
4302,Neutral,"@mrtnptrs yes, it is. We should not crash even on invalid parks.

I have made a PR to address that: https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/pull/6576"
4303,Neutral,"@duncanspumpkin there's no need for protection from 0-sized buffer. As per [docs](http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/memory/realloc):

> If new_size is zero, the behavior is implementation defined (null pointer may be returned (in which case the old memory block may or may not be freed), or some non-null pointer may be returned that may not be used to access storage). 

we do the proper thing."
4304,Neutral,"Any chance you could provide a .TD6 that causes a crash. I found a problem with .TD4 files that cause an instant crash but I don't have any corrupt .TD6 files so its hard to reproduce. 
"
4305,Neutral,"I don't see how it would require new save format, sounds doable within constraints of sv6."
4306,Neutral,"Yeah I was thinking it might be related. I was going to check to see if it had any custom paths in use.

4307,Neutral,"I tried to change SPRITE_LOCATION_NULL so it was globally fixed for any comparisons that used SPRITE_LOCATION_NULL.
"
4308,Neutral,"> The reason it's a compile-time option in the first place is that the code can affect a lot of other stuff, even when the feature is not used.

Not really"
4309,Negative,But never mind. I found a way to make it work and I'm terrible with computers so it's okay. Just blame the magnetic field I somehow have around me.
4310,Neutral,"I believe you can also close the ride a second time, forcing them out, as another temporary workaround
"
4311,Neutral,"@janisozaur oh, didn't see that. I'll see where its crashing this evening.
"
4312,Neutral,Does the sv6 have more chunks than we read?
4313,Positive,"Wow, I've never received a bug report reply so fast before!

I will try to reproduce this behavior later with more care.

What's is missing to make a port for linux? Maybe I can help in something.
"
4314,Neutral,"The game does warn you about other track configuration problems, like block brakes after another or before a station, non-complete track or more than one pull lift. I am going to make this a feature request to warn the player if there is no free block immediately upon starting the ride.
"
4315,Neutral,"As this is a duplicate of #1860, please move the discussion to there.

4316,Neutral,"Hm, I think it has more to do with the fact his path seems to contain `<` and `>`.

4317,Neutral,"No dump file that I can see; where would it be?

Just tell me what you want to see--I don't mind transcribing a screenshot if it helps.

One _could_ argue that it's up to CS to determine if a file is sv6 or not.

Gymnasiast, as a side note, I tried using the 8 cars per train function (1.302) on RCT2 running on a Windows 98 virtual machine, but it doesn't appear to work.
"
4364,Neutral,"If its only slow when there are many guests (things to draw) that is a limit of how fast it can draw. We can't optimise that any further until the whole game is complete - and isn't directly related to scrolling.
"
4365,Neutral,"The original game uses native Windows dialog boxes and have the text initially highlighted, so you can simply hit backspace to clear the input box. It would be nice if our input boxes had that functionality.

IMO, the diamond makes the icon too busy. But I don't care too much because Windows lets you change EXE icons _and_ one EXE can bundle multiple icons. Here's RCT2's selections (used for different program features).

"
4395,Positive,"Fair enough - I assumed they were more separate on some level. Ignore me :+1: 
"
4396,Neutral,"It has probably saved the scenario in a compatibility directory.
"
4397,Neutral,"This _might_ have been fixed by accident in https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/commit/e85c627bd5d6db14ac429c1695f421dd14d08ec3, because it avoid error messages about building in pause mode. It's probably best to see if this happens again for a few weeks, then close it if it doesn't."
4398,Neutral,"I see. Well maybe sometime in the future as an option perhaps. 
"
4399,Neutral,"It fails because running `openrct2` fails. Presumably you can't run `./openrct2` either? It appears it can't find `libopenrct2.so`, now usually when it links a library to the binary, it stores the location to it so that it can load it - but that doesn't appear to work in this case? Alternatively you can set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to the directory that contains `libopenrct2.so` or move that into `/usr/lib`."
4400,Neutral,"I just found another infiniteloop...
but that would be another freeze, not a crash."
4401,Neutral,"So I guess a loop counter then? But what would be a reasonable max number of loops?
"
4402,Neutral,"From memory the only dll's that should be required are openrct2 and sdl2.dll. Make sure these are in the same directory as openrct2.exe. Everything else should be handled by wine. 
"
4403,Neutral,It's inconsistent and I have yet to reproduce it. When I do (and manage to grab the dump file) I will upload it.
4404,Neutral,"As it seems, the Mini Game scenarios are essentially damaged. I think I'll introduce an option (off by default) to allow loading of damaged saves/scenarios.
"
4405,Neutral,"Yeah, by import we plan to support rct1 files but play them based on rct2 mechanics"
4406,Neutral,"Someone is pretending to be me in a server and lying to me now. I think it is a great idea to add a login system to OpenRCT2 and stop using anonymous names to prevent impersonations in the future. I also want the login systems to be added to OpenRCT2 as soon as possible to prevent impostors.

4407,Neutral,"See #844 and #1962.
"
4408,Neutral,"What are 55 and 59?
"
4409,Negative,"I hate wide path flags!
The issue here is that the wide path flags are acting like a wall through the patrol zone.
This is something that I had not thought of until now, but it jumped out at me as soon as I read the error report and saw the screenshot, even before I checked where the wide paths are flagged in this path layout.

The path finding heuristic currently only allows peeps to continue searching through a wide path tile if the peep is currently on a wide tile. This helps avoid peeps getting stuck in the classic scenario where the pathing requires the peep to first walk away from destination in order to get there.

It is trivial to relax this restriction, fixing this case, but the cost will be significantly worse path finding.

I need to think this over for a bit to see if I can come up with some logic that fixes this issue related to patrol areas but does not negatively impact the path finding heuristic in general... maybe ignore the wide path flag if the path tile is on the edge of the patrol zone."
4410,Neutral,"@xzbobzx: maybe 48 also without text...

4411,Neutral,"Hmm the only thing I can think of is it running out of sprite ids. Is this only in one save, has that save been used for a long time?

"
4413,Positive,"Nothing really to worry about. Thats just one of our new protection features to stop invalid memory access. It crashes if its not handled correctly. Since its not crashing its handling it fine.
"
4414,Neutral,"The text that normally goes after the pluses comes from the Windows registry.

```
reg query ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Infogrames\RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 Setup""
reg query ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Infogrames\RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 Setup""
```

Maybe ORCT2 failed to read from the registry.
"
4415,Neutral,"this appears on many finished rides as well - if you look closely at the looping roller coaster, it somehow cannot fit 7 cars in 6 station platforms yet it somehow never uses any portion of that last block.
"
4416,Negative,"I did look for such but didn't find anything. I don't think it makes a
difference if the vehicle type is single or trains but i don't know.

4418,Positive,It finally works using that method! Thanks to @LRFLEW and everybody. And sorry for my noobiness. 
4419,Neutral,"I don't think its related to #1720. Is this reproducable in vanilla RCT2?
"
4420,Positive,"You should use the actual names of the tracks, that would make it a lot easier to distinguish between styles and tracks. For example: 'Techno style' and 'Brimble's beat'. :)

4421,Neutral,"I managed to crash the game on Six Flags Great Adventure and on Fungus Woods so I don't think it has something to do with the map
"
4422,Positive,Seems like the commit of 591aa8a fixes the bugging main menu. Thanks!
4423,Neutral,"Are there any messages on the cmd prompt window? Sounds like an issue with loading. When the title fails to load it tries to reset and reload the title. That is probably why it freezes.
"
4424,Neutral,"You could add a notification, e.g. Mechanic X can't reach [ride] due to his patrol area. Preferably clearer than that though.
"
4425,Negative,@Broxzier you just described my solutions again. 
4426,Neutral,"I just checked it on my RCT1 install. After the long Grapevine (Funtopia) shot, a series of shorter shots of around a few seconds each follow. It doesn't look like there is a time difference, but that set contains a few very precisely-timed shots. In other words: it starts just when the a roller coaster train does something interesting. Recreations of RCT1 scenarios don't always have the trains in exactly the same location (not surprising, really). So in short: it doesn't look like the OpenRCT2 version is faster-paced. I'll therefore close this.
"
4427,Neutral,"@Gymnasiast I'm having trouble opening your save file. It's complaining with a bunch of ""failed to load entry"" errors. I'm assuming it's custom scenery I don't have. Can you link to the custom scenery you used? Is it possible to include the custom scenery in the save?
"
4428,Negative,"@Christipher : Stay on-topic please. What you describe is another bug entirely.
"
4429,Neutral,"@janisozaur We can already sort by track ride or ride type, so adding a way to filter by checked status shouldn't really present problems, I think.
"
4430,Negative,"I believe that gray them out will be a bad ux experience.
"
4431,Negative,"I could still reproduce the bug in 93484c7956324c6b4589b0929aa914a10dc9f1e7

As long as the dialog remains opened while editing the track, newly added block sections are correctly counted in the settings tab, but don't allow to add additional trains until the whole window is closed and re-opened.

If the train length was above the smallest block size, lowering it accordingly doesn't allow it either to increase the number of trains directly. The windows needs to re-opened in this case as well.

it only works as expected when increasing the train length after lowering the train count. In this case, the upper train count limit is scaled down immediately.

4435,Neutral,@davewthompson how's the experience for you now that we've merged #5578?
4436,Negative,"I like how it currently is more than both of these proposals. Maybe these are easier to click but they're not as intuitive as the default up/down arrows. I think people are way more likely to press the wrong button with your proposed design.

But to be honest I've never had problems clicking these buttons. At least I can't recall it being an issue!

4437,Negative,"The problem seems to be fixed @ the latest build, thanks @IntelOrca !

edit: placing new rides will crash again :(

4446,Neutral,"Note that some languages (mostly Asian, to my knowledge) group decimals [differently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_mark#Digit_grouping). I know unicode characters are unsupported at the moment, but it does mean that the proposed solution might not suffice in the long run.
"
4447,Positive,"Yup regression is caused by my track refactor. Shouldn't take too long to find the cause.
"
4448,Neutral,"OK, I think the most likely cause is string encoding. Sounds are being loaded with a function that expects UTF8 encoded filenames, where as all the filenames are currently stored as extended ASCII.

- From guest's ride list
- From ride list
"
4451,Neutral,"But it does work for parts that aren't C, I just tested it on sound_play_panned which I found uses 5 different registers as parameters and was able to easily decompile the rest of it.  If you aren't hooking the functions then you can't test if they will actually work as a replacement, unless you decompile all the other functions that are calling it.  It also makes it easier and faster to decompile, because you can see what parameters are being passed when its being called from code that hasn't been figured out yet.  I have also updated the hook to map registers to C style function arguments: http://pastebin.com/AThD9Bcp

"
4457,Neutral,"There are already shortcut keys that you can map, for switching the direction you want. "
4458,Neutral,"I think its worth keeping the common open file dialog on Windows for users that want that experience. We can improve how it is current displayed because at the moment its a button that isn't even aligned to the window properly and has a non-intuitive label. Perhaps we can have a option to have the native dialog open by default, if its disabled then it opens the in-game window with a button to open the native dialog.

Windows and OSX provide a common API for this, so this thread is for what should be used in Linux. And I assume something like GTK+ is very easy to add to the unix build process right?
"
4459,Neutral,"the other thing I would say is it has to be next laterally - vertical up or down should not count (should not check vertical as there would be a roof there effectively)

This might be worth fixing so when you disable day/night cycle, palette gets reset to 'day'.

So I guess there are more cursor functions although I don't know which ones, maybe resetCursor or something. Also it is strange that the cursor does not get reset at one pixel between the standard buttons and the viewport.

Anyway, I put the function as far as I have it in my fork with a printf just before setting the cursor.

Coming from here:
https://realm.io/docs/objc/latest/#migrations

It was well explained how to migrate the default Realm.

How does migration in this case work?

```
newRealm.configuration = configuration

Is it enough? Anyway, instead of guessing, I would highly appreciate a documentation example or any explanation on this topic, or a place where it is already explained but I was dumb enough not to find it.

## Goals

Just using Realm.

## Expected Results

No bugs, no freeze, no warnings.

## Actual Results

I'm getting this using Realm v2.4.4, but I got a customer getting that same freeze using v2.0.4, so I was wrong when I was saying that issue was introduced *after* 2.0.4 (cf the previous issue).

The app is freezing after logging ""N5realm10LogicErrorE: Bad version number"".
Looks like a deadlock (since the audio is still playing, just the interface won't respond anymore)

Here the full stack trace from Xcode when the app has entered in the _deadlock_:

## Steps to Reproduce

Once again, I don't have an easy way to reproduce it. It's a global environment issue: having a few realm transactions running at the same time, after a few more, it will freeze.
In this context, my realm is storing around 50k objects, not sure if that can change something.

## Code Sample

Sadly, don't have one... but I will try right now to make a sample project reproducing that issue since I have a better idea of the context.

4509,Neutral,"In some cases it would be nice to be able to close the realm instance by calling a close() or closeRealm() method on the RLMRealm instance.

And everytime I start my app,  I will run this configuration. The data persisted last time was gone.

When should I config realm? Should I config it everytime when I start my app?
"
4511,Neutral,"## Goals

The current Realm API seemed to be focused on accessing persisted object ""on-the-fly"" from anywhere in the app. While this can be beneficial and simple to use, a more complex, layered architecture cannot be achieved with this.
I'm talking about an architecture where database access is limited to a separate **Data** layer so effectivelyI would only use Realm there. I'm trying to implement this architecture using RxSwift, where I would like to pass business entities (which are Realm objects) via Observables to the **Domain** layer, where my business logic is implemented using RxSwift operators and finally, the result will arrive to the **Presentation** layer which includes ViewControllers and Views. The core of this is that everything before the Presentation layer have to be done in a separate thread asynchronously which could be achieved easily with RxSwift. Realm objects however cannot be passed between threads, so it makes this approach impossible. However, in Java, Realm already has a solution which would be nice in Swift. More details:

## Expected Results

**Add `copyFromRealm()`method** to the Swift API of Realm to enable passing a ""detached"", in-memory version of Realm objects between methods, thus enabling using RxSwift in a multi-layered architecture with business logic in a separate domain layer and a different thread (RxSwift scheduler).

No error related to Realm

## Actual Results

`Module compiled with Swift 3.0.2 cannot be imported in Swift 3.1: RealmSwift.framework`

After I updated the project with Realm for Swift 3.1 downloaded from [here](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/), got this issue `Command failed due to signal: Illegal instruction: 4` in all model files using Realm

Tried removing the frameworks and using CocoaPods instead, but the issues persist.

a.replaceSubrange(a.indices, with: [1, 2, 3])

With `List<T>` you get an error because `List.Indices` is `DefaultRandomAccessIndices<List<T>>`, for which there's no overload. This should really work.

I took a brief stab at making it work but ran into a mysterious problem.  [`RangeReplaceableCollection`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/swift/rangereplaceablecollection) provides some overloads that take a `CountableRange<Int>`, so I tried changing `List.Indices` to be an alias for `CountableRange<Int>`, but for some reason the Swift compiler still won't use that overload. It appears to only see the overloads that take a `Range<Int>`."

## Version of Realm and Tooling

Realm version: Newest 
(i just add github ""realm/realm-cocoa"" in my Cartfile and run carthage update this morning, nothing else)

Xcode version: Version 8.1 (8B62)

Swift version: 3.0.1

OSX: 10.11.6 (15G1108)

Pretty sure it happens with swift 2.3 xcode 8.0 too. I doubt that this happen in many platforms and versions

## What cause the bug: 

Property name begins with ""new*"" like ""newA, newB, newXXX""

## How to fix

change 
````Swift    
dynamic var newName: String = ""tên mới""
````
to 
````Swift    
dynamic var name: String = ""tên mới"" // or do whatever that not use ""new*"" for property name
````

## Broke-in-tear comment:

It took me tons of time to figure out why it crash while there're no clue about it, i have to cut of my code many, many time to the version that i reported.
Hope Realm team can fix or at least warn other about this because bug like this is so brutal, it might cause nightmare to other (like what happen to me)

"
4521,Positive,"I've been evaluating Realm and its performance.  An important use case of mine involves large numbers (100000+) of ""micro objects"".  These are really small objects with no more than a few fields, most of which are numbers (for this test no more than 64 bytes of data total).  Query performance is very good, even with high object counts, but adding, deleting, and modifying large numbers of objects from Realm can be very slow.

**Test setting:**
- Realm version:  0.83.
- Hardware / OS:  2.3Ghz Retina MacBook Pro / OS X 10.9.4.
- No properties are indexed or have any attributes (confirmed with attributesForProperty:).
- Using the defaultRealm.
- Setting `[RLMRealm useInMemoryDefaultRealm]` has no effect (not that I could run this way for production).
- Setting `defaultRealm.autorefresh = NO` has no effect (and it always seems to be turned on again during subsequent uses of the realm).

**Add objects test:**
I am generating n RLMObjects, adding them to an NSArray, then timing adding that array to the realm with `[realm transactionWithBlock:^{  [realm addObjectsFromArray:array];  }];`
- Adding a 100000 object array:  10.891676 seconds!
- Adding a 50000 object array:  2.418253 seconds!
- Adding a 25000 object array:  0.660159 seconds.
- Adding a 10000 object array:  0.131164 seconds.

It does not seem to matter how many objects are in the realm prior to adding the objects.  Adding a 10000 object array takes the same time if 0 objects are in the Realm or 1 million objects are in the Realm.

**Remove objects test:**
I am taking n RLMObjects that exist in the Realm, adding them to an NSArray, then timing removing that array from the realm with `[realm transactionWithBlock:^{  [realm deleteObjects:itemsToRemove];  }];`
- Removing a 100000 object array:  10.855915 seconds!
- Removing a 50000 object array:  2.325231 seconds!
- Removing a 25000 object array:  0.597455 seconds.
- Removing a 10000 object array:  0.102262 seconds.

It's basically the same performance as the add case.  Like the add case, the number of objects that exist in the Realm do not seem to impact delete performance.

**Modify objects test:**
I am taking the first n RLMObjects from a 100000 object Realm and changing a single integer property similar to above.
- Modifying 100000 objects:  9 _minutes_ 8.5386 seconds! (!!)
- Modifying 50000 objects:  4 _minutes_ 36.5388 seconds! (!!)
- Modifying 25000 objects:  2 _minutes_ 18.1554 seconds! (!!)
- Modifying 10000 objects:  55.511092 seconds! (!!)
- Modifying 5000 objects:  27.538283 seconds! (!)
- Modifying 1000 objects:  5.507278 seconds!
- Modifying 500 objects:  2.797262 seconds!
- Modifying 100 objects:  0.545877 seconds!

Taking the first n RLMObjects from a 10000 object Realm and changing a single integer property similar to above.
- Modifying 10000 objects:  5.118958 seconds!
- Modifying 5000 objects:  2.646211 seconds!
- Modifying 1000 objects:  0.525338 seconds!
- Modifying 500 objects:  0.270613 seconds!
- Modifying 100 objects:  0.056823 seconds.

The number of objects in the Realm do impact performance here.  From these results, when you have 10x the objects in the Realm, the result is about 10x slower performance for the same number of objects modified in a single transaction!

**Takeaways:**
- When adding and removing items from a Realm, generally, using more transactions with fewer objects performs significantly faster than using fewer transitions with more objects.  i.e., Add 10 batches of 10K objects instead of 1 batch of 100K objects.  I have not approximated the point of diminishing returns with this.  This shouldn't be.  When adding an array of objects, Realm knows the total number of items it is getting and has a schema for all of them.  It should be able to make decent estimates for the amount of memory it needs to allocate (and with some objects, perfect estimates) and the space it needs to free.
- Modifying is show-stopper expensive, even in a ""very small"" (for my case) 10K object Realm with fewer objects being modified.  While I have not tried this, from the data above it seems like it would be faster to query Realm for the objects in question, delete them, recreate new instances with the correct properties, and add them, combining it with the multi-batch approach mentioned above.  This should not be the case.  That's more work (and more needless notifications generated).
- Deleting objects taking as long as adding objects - I don't know what to think.  It is not vacuuming the Realm file.

**Other notes:**
- Memory use remained acceptable throughout the testing.

I generally like Realm's API and how to thinks about things even with what it has missing.  I'd like to use it, but it doesn't seem particularly suited for this use case.  Thoughts about what can be done here or what the timeline is for improvements?
"
4522,Neutral,"I want to delete an object with all its referencing objects. Since there is not yet a cascading delete I do the following:

```
try! self.realm.write {
    self.realm.delete(customer.address);
    self.realm.delete(customer.contact);
    self.realm.delete(customer.history);
    self.realm.delete(customer); // app crashes here
}
```

Deleting the address, the contact and the history object works fine. But when it comes to deleting the customer object itself the error is:

`'RLMException', reason: 'Object has been deleted or invalidated.'`

I thought doing all this inside the write transaction would do the trick but it doesnt. So how am I supposed to delete the customer object after I deleted all referenced objects?"
4523,Negative,"Hi,

I'm using Realm `v0.98.3` and ReactiveCocoa `v4`. I have an issue with `List`. I have a similar case as the documentation your wrote.

```
public class Dog: Object {
    dynamic public var name: String = """"
}

public class Person: Object {

    dynamic public var name: String = """"
    public let dogs = List<Dog>()

}

public class ViewModel {

    public var person: AnyProperty<Person?> { return AnyProperty(_person) }

    private var _person = MutableProperty<Person?>(nil)

    public func setExistingPerson(person: Person) {
        // print(person) ==> List of dogs is OK
        self._person.value = person
        // print(self._person.value) ==> The list of dogs is empty.
    }

}

final class ViewController: UIViewController {

    private var db: Realm?
    private let viewModel = ViewModel()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.            self.db = try Realm()
        } catch { }

        if let existingPerson = self.db?.objectForPrimaryKey(Person.self, key: ""puri"") {
            self.viewModel.setExistingPerson(existingPerson)
        }
    }

}
```

If I print the list of People before assign it to a `MutableProperty`, the objects contains the correct list of dogs. After assign it, if I execute `print(db.objects(Person.self))` the list of dogs for each person is empty. It has a weird behavior, it seems like it's deleting the reference for list objects after assign it. I don't understand why.

Thanks

Sometimes, we get reports in a production app about the fact that Realm objects are accessed from an incorrect thread. Troubleshooting those could be a little easier if we get some more information in the exception.
## Expected Results

Instead of just getting the plain exception, we would like to get the following result:

```
Realm object of type <classname> accessed from incorrect thread <thread_name>.
```

This would give you at least a clue on where to start looking.

The problem in Objective-C is that when you get this error in a block, it's very hard to find the correct stack trace that leads you to the source of the problem.

Filter an array based on it's child

What do you want to achieve?

An array is filtered based on it's child

What did you expected to happen?

## Actual Results

Array is filtered, but not completely, I.e missing objects that should be in  there

## Steps to Reproduce

Create two Realm objects, and filter based on child.

## Code Sample

Example:

```swift
class Class: Object {
    dynamic var name = """"
    dynamic var semester: Semester?

    convenience init(withName name: String, inSemester semester: Semester) {
        self.init()
        self.name = name
        self.semester = semester
    }
    
}
```

```swift
class Semester: Object {
    static let terms = [""Spring"", ""Summer"", ""Fall"", ""Winter""]
    dynamic var term = """"
    dynamic var year = 0
    
    convenience init(withTerm term: String, andYear year: Int) {
        self.init()
        self.term = term
        self.year = year
    }
    
    
    override static func ignoredProperties() -> [String] {
        return [""terms""]
    }
    
    // MARK: Equatable overrides
 
    static func ==(lhs: Semester, rhs: Semester) -> Bool {
        if (lhs.term == rhs.term) && (lhs.year == rhs.year) { return true }
        else { return false }
    }

    override func isEqual(_ object: Any?) -> Bool {
        guard let sem = object as? Semester else {
            return false
        }
        if (self.term == sem.term) && (self.year == sem.year) { return true }
        else { return false }
    }
    
}
```

Now lets say you have an array of Classes (Realm Results)

```swift
 var arr = [class1, class2, class3]
// For example purposes class1, and class2 are in the same semester
// In other words, doing class1.semeser == class2.semester return true (because of equatable ==)

// Doing this with a semester equal to class1, and class2 I'd expect an array with [class1, class2]
let filtered = realm.objects(Class.self).filter(""semester == %@"", semester)

// However what actually gets returned is just [class1]

// So the above doesn't work, but this does
let working = realm.objects(Class.self).filter(""semester.term == %@ AND semester.year == %@"", semester.term, semester.year)
```

Not sure what could be going on (not that experienced using Realm)
But I would imagine that if I overrode Equatable (==, and isEqual) that both solutions would work.

Install Realm in a new Swift application
## Expected Results

I expected to follow the Carthage installation instructions on the Getting Started section of the Realm docs at Realm.io
## Actual Results

Following the instructions results in a linker error with frameworks not located. 
## Steps to Reproduce

Follow the Carthage installation instructions using Xcode 7.3.1 
## Code Sample

n/a
## Suggested fix

Correct installation instructions.  With Xcode 7.3.1 simply dragging Realm.framework and RealmSwift.framework binaries into the embedded binaries section of the General tab in Xcode is all that is required.  The app store submission bug that the complex instructions addresses is an Xcode 6.x specific bug. 

This is a big time suck if you are new to using embedded binaries as you have to figure out why you are getting linker errors

4529,Neutral,"Creating a new issue based off the discussion in this PR: https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/pull/2906.

For component work, it is helpful to have a single code-base that will work with Realm objects. To facilitate that there needs to be an interface that makes available the underlying ObjC objects within the Swift objects.

It was suggested adding:

``` swift
@objc public class ObjectiveCCompability {
  public func rlmResults(results: Results) -> RLMResults { ... }
  public func rlmArray(list: List) -> RLMArray { ... }
  public func rlmCollection(collection: RealmCollectionType) -> RLMCollection { ... }

4532,Neutral,"## Goals

Filter/query an object

## Expected Results

Have the object returned

## Actual Results
The object is returned, but with default values

## Steps to Reproduce

Call my filter function
```swift
self.channel = DatabaseManager.channel(with: channelId)
```

## Code Sample

Model:


```swift
class func channel(with id:Int) -> MSChannel? {
        let realm = try! Realm()
        let predicate = NSPredicate(format: ""identifier = %d"", id)
        let channels = realm.objects(MSChannel.self).filter(predicate)

Xcode version: 8.1

iOS/OSX version: iOS 9

How should i use the **filter** to get AA whose bb has a row (id1 = '1' and id2 = '2')
if i write 

``` swift
realm.objects(AA).filter(""ANY  bb.id1 = '1' AND ANY bb.id2 = '2'"").count  // get 1,not right

4539,Neutral,"So I have a app extension that writes to my shared container that has my realm file. My app is just a visual list of all the objects within my table in the realm file. I following mostly what apple has done with extensions  and notice that when I write something from the extension and then head over to my main app, that app for some reason does not see the new object. 

Currently I am just reopening the realm that they share to read from it. The refresh for this instance doesn't seem to work with it. 

Would this be a issue with how long it takes to write to my realm file?

4540,Positive,"Hi,

I'm using latest version of xCode 6 (beta4) and I'm try using Realm in a swift iOs project with CocoaPods without any success.

I'm getting the following error on build time : 
<b>File not Found ""Realm/Realm-Bridging-Header.h"" </b>

I notice that @jpsim post a [radar](http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5771227683618816) to solve this problem.

Until xCode team fixes the issue, is there a workaround?

Thanks,

PS : Realm looks very powerful, I can't wait for running it on my app. :)
"
4541,Neutral,"Hi there, currently I'm observing a strange behaviour while using Realm. It seems that every time I open the my App (be it a restart of the app, or a background foreground process) seems to increase the size of the realm file without having new objects being stored. So the amount of objects stored are not changing at least not dramatically, explaining an increase of Realm file size by 1000%. Weird?! 

So I'm not sure if this is a problem how I implemented/integrated Realm in my app or if it is a issue from your side. 

A test with my iPhone 6s has shown that the Realm file increased from 4 mb to 200 mb by closing, reopening, moving it to background and back to foreground again multiple times.

Is there away to extract a Realm file to see where/what all this data is if it is not coming from stored object data it must be Metadata, right? I can also provide a copy of the big file!

**Updated 24.02.2017 12.15:**

After moving back to Realm version 2.0.3 used in a previous release and not touching my Realm code it seems this issue is not occurring. "
4542,Neutral,"I've been using RLMResults as my data model for my tableview. One of my models has an optional property (date). I need to sort my RLMResults array using this property.

Here's my Goal model:

``` swift
class DateObject: RLMObject {
    dynamic var date: NSDate = NSDate()
}

class Goal: RLMObject {
    dynamic var user = User()
    dynamic var name = """"
    dynamic var desc = """"
    ...
    dynamic var targetDate: DateObject?
}
```

Here's my RLMResults (without sort):

``` swift
var bodyGoals:RLMResults {
        get {
            var predicate = NSPredicate(format: ""user.email = %@ AND ..."", user!.email, ...)   
            return Goal.objectsWithPredicate(predicate)
        }
    }
```

This is how I was trying to sort:

``` swift
return Goal.objectsWithPredicate(predicate).sortedResultsUsingProperty(""targetDate.date"", ascending: false)
```

Which gives me the error below (which makes sense):

``` swift
Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'Invalid sort column', reason: 'Column named '(null)' not found.'
```

What options do I have now? What would be the best approach to solve this? Is there something like sortedArrayUsingComparator to RLMResults?
"
4543,Positive,"Realm Browser will sometimes shift the column names.  Test database is here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/63662632/realm.realm

When going to ""Match"" via the panel on the left, everything is displayed as expected.

When going to Competition -> Click on ""Match (200)"" the columns appear to be shifted.  Under the heading ""match"" there is ""Team (3)"", and under the heading ""blueTeams"" there is the officalRedScore.

I assume that this is an issue with Realm Browser, because it works when viewing the matches directly from the panel on the left.

Thanks,

4544,Neutral,"Hi!
Using Realm 0.94.1, Xcode 6.

Imagine we have two classes: Person and Dog, with a one-to-many relationship, the only thing that Dog doesn't know about the person. 
And I wish to make a migration that will add a Person property to Dog class.

Before I post what i've tried so far, I guess it's worth asking first: did you guys implement such possibility?

"
4549,Negative,"@tonyarnold I don't think that's related. The carthage issue is that built artefacts in `Carthage.build` contain `x86_64` and `i386` architectures that are rejected by the app store :(
"
4550,Positive,"Okay good to know. I will change to `NSFileProtectionNone` for now. Can you confirm that changing in the entitlements file is the right way to go about this until you guys add support to `RLMConfiguration`?
"
4551,Neutral,"Also, in the code you provided your two different configurations appear to point to the same file, and have the same schema version numbers. Is that really the case?"
4552,Neutral,"@grantspilsbury We're working making the app public https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/pull/4269 . 
It will be available very soon."
4553,Neutral,"I can see how `obj.writeAsync { realm, obj in }` is a bit more succinct, but I do think that it breaks the current expectation that transactions are done on the Realm.

I would also expect a `writeAsync` method to eventually support passing in more than one object, in which case it could get pretty complex having it on the objects itself (requiring a separate type for groups of objects)."
4554,Neutral,"My solution is:

```
extension RealmModel: Hashable { }

func ==(lhs: RealmModel, rhs: RealmModel) -> Bool {
  //...Do your judgement here
}
```

It works for me.
It's quite strange that you can use `==` between two `Object`s directly, but we have to implement this method again for ""conforming"" to the `Hashable` protocol.
"
4555,Neutral,"Discussion at https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/51071 suggests that the _absence of an entitlements file_ can result in keychain calls failing with `errSecMissingEntitlement` in the simulator.

If so, please continue the discussion there. Stack Overflow is the best place to support."
4557,Negative,"Your problem is entirely unrelated to this issue. `[RLMRealmConfiguration defaultConfiguration].deleteRealmIfMigrationNeeded = YES;` does not do anything because you're mutating a newly created object and then discarding it. You must set `deleteRealmIfMigrationNeeded` on a configuration object and then pass that object to `[RLMRealmConfiguration setDefaultConfiguration:]`.
"
4558,Neutral,"@rrrlasse There are no 0-bytes in the strings, as they are IBANs.

@tgoyne I'll try to asterisk out the sensitive parts of the data and send you the database file along with the encryption key.

I should also note that the results are returned correctly when indexes are not hit, i.e. performing CONTAINS or BEGINSWITH on the indexed string column.
"
4559,Positive,"Thanks for the feature request, @anbarasu0504. We have a number of high priority features we'd like to build before diving into something like this, but it would certainly be nice to have at some point.

If you, or anyone, feels like contributing to this, please start with a design proposal in this issue demonstrating how the feature should work, which API it should expose and how to deal with potential pitfalls:
1. What kind of operations and/or models can be undone?
2. Should undos be grouped by transaction? Or by some other mechanism? Or not grouped at all?
3. What happens in a multithreaded or multiprocess scenario?
4. How can we efficiently compact the transaction log to only preserve history which can be undone while discarding the irrelevant aspects?
"
4560,Neutral,"@jhoughjr have you tried applying the strategies suggested in this thread? You mention you've tried copying the Realm objects into an Array and that not working. Can you please elaborate? How about the associated object approach?

"
4563,Neutral,"If we do this at all we should add it to the userInfo for the exception, not to the message.

There is currently not a common code path used for exceptions at the moment so this requires changing quite a bit of code.
"
4564,Neutral,"I do understand that `Object` is supposed to not be used directly. That is fine. I am all about best practices. I can use another method besides creating an `Object` instance directly. 

I got the idea to creating an `Object` instance from [your comment in this issue](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/issues/4005#issuecomment-285221162). 

Is there another way to create an unmanaged instance from a managed instance of an object? I come from the realm-java lib where creating unmanaged instances of managed instances is built into the lib. What is the realm-cocoa equivalent or best practice instead? 

My use case: I perform a realm query to get a realm `Object` > I perform a write on this object > Perform an API call > Perform another write on this object. 

I am trying to create an unmanaged object because I can share the object across threads (as I will be on a different thread after the API call is performed since the API call will be performed on another thread and the callback after it is complete will be called from this API thread).

I was looking through the Realm docs yesterday for Swift and it mentioned [passing instances across threads](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#passing-instances-across-threads). I am guessing this is the realm-cocoa equivalent to working with managed objects across threads? 

I don't mind this solution. However, it does not seem as flexible as creating an unmanaged object. Unmanaged objects are very flexible do handle them however you would like. The biggest limitation that I see is `A ThreadSafeReference object must be resolved at most once.` I may have scenarios that I would need to resolve a ThreadSafeReference 2+ times. What do I do in this case? Is there a pattern that users usually do? "
4565,Positive,"Thanks for filing that radar, @dgrekov. Let's keep this issue open as a reminder to check again once Xcode 7 goes GM.
"
4566,Neutral,"This appears to be a segfault in `object_isClass(_:)`, which itself is being called by Foundation's KVO machinery. I'd guess this is a bug in iOS rather than Realm. Have you filed a radar for this?

4576,Neutral,The first issue I've noticed in your code is that your models' properties are not declared as `dynamic` (see [docs](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#property-attributes)). Second: if you want to have relationship between `UserInfo` and `UserDevice` you should use `List` type and declare this property as `let devices = List<UserDevice>()` (see [docs](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#to-many-relationships) for more info). However the `List` type is not supported by ObjectMapper out of the box so you'll probably need to implement your own `TransformType` to map JSON to your models. See more info and examples here: https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper/issues/143

4581,Neutral,"Steps:
- [ ] expose a C-header interface to the C++ bits of Realm Cocoa
- [ ] have minimal Swift with SwiftPM build system that calls into some symbols to demonstrate that the build system works
- [ ] write a basic ""dynamic""-ish API, not built on top of existing Realm Cocoa
- [ ] come up with a possibly verbose, but comprehensive subset of the API
- [ ] possibly have a codegen tool to generate models, or find an alternative mechanism for accessors
"
4582,Neutral,"See  issue [2135](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/issues/2135) which is the same problem.   It was recently closed as a Swift/lldb problem, not a realm problem.

4583,Negative,"I reopened the Java ticket, as it is a Java responsibility then. I am completely baffled we missed this however :(

The task now is the following IMO: 
1) Create automated test-suite to test interoperability as discussed before, i.e. each platform creates a test suite that A) can create a set of test files and B) run those files through a series of unit tests. Then it should be relatively easy to create a set of test files for each version released that can be sent to the other platform to verify we do not regress.

2) Realm Java will fix the bug on our side: 1) Stop appending ""class_"" to names in the pk_table 2) Make a fallback so it works in both cases with and without ""class_"" prefix.

Is the static library distributed with the Realm Cocoapods release built in 6.3 or 6.2? The internal C++ library we are using is built with 6.3, but I could also try building it with 6.2 before linking in 6.3.

The dev forum post by the Apple dev support agent suggests that this will go away in the next Xcode 6.4 beta, so I may try that as well.

The absence of this feature itself doesn't bother me--I can get by. What bothers me is how can it be possible that this feature, which they said was coming soon last September (and maybe earlier), isn't here yet.

Oh dear. I've had that issue in a lot of my apps before as well. The error usually implies that there was something wrong with the file path you specified, but that sadly means there could be any number of issues with it. Usually the first point of debugging this sort of issue is to print your file path value to the console and see if anything looks incomplete/malformed

In this case, I think the issue might be the way you're converting an `NSURL` value to a `String` in order to pass it to Realm's `writeCopyToPath` method.

Instead of `String(url4)`, try `url4.path` and let me know if that fixes it. :)

Thanks!
"
4607,Neutral,"@virt87 no, the `if` statement is correct. Once you've opened a Realm at that path, you cannot set a different schema version for that path, since the open Realm would not be able to update to that new schema version you've set.

"
4609,Neutral,"ok so suppose I have ToDoItem containing list of comments. Then I can use filter on comments is it so?
"
4610,Negative,"still nothing on this?
This problem is causing 99% of all of my Realm crashes.
"
4611,Neutral,"Update.  I was able to resolve the issue somewhat by switching to the `al-swift` branch and building the `RealmSwift.framework`.  It created a couple of other minor problems, but all of these had easy workarounds.  It seams that the `RealmSwift.List<Class>` syntax somehow fixes something in the underlying order of operations.
"
4612,Positive,Feel free to comment below or file a new issue if you do @i-schuetz! :)
4613,Negative,Amazing 👍 It's our biggest crash atm though <1% of users affected.
4614,Neutral,"I just ran into this exact same issue on 0.91.3. Is querying a related `RLMArray` property not allowed anymore?
"
4615,Neutral,"Okay so this what I am trying to do, unify my create delete update logic into one interface called 

``` Obj-c

-(void) saveObjectGraphWithRoot: (RLMObject*) objectRoot {
if ( rootObject.primarykey  == nil) {  // assuming it doesn't have a primary key then it must be persisted

}
else if (rootObject.primarykey !=nil){ // it has primary key then it can be updated.

} 
else if (rootObject.isMarkedForDelete = YES) {// delete this

}

}
```

So two questions to help me out, in the latest version of Realm ...
Have you included primary key properties on the objects by it's self ? or do I have to override the function to get generate a primary key? 

``` Obj-C
+ (NSString *)primaryKey {
    return @""key""; // generate key here ?
}
```

Are the primary keys generated when the object is created in memory ? or when the object is committed ?
"
4616,Negative,"Hey Bernhard, sorry that I didn't got back to you earlier, missed that you filed an issue over here.

> Usually this should work without any problems, just bump the schemaVersion and add an empty migration block.
> Here was the first hurdle we had to add a migration since it was crashing. So we added the following migration.

That's true. How was it crashing for you? How were you testing the migration?

---

Coming to the problem you're seeing with the deployed version: Did you added `dateSaved` as a property and users could be stuck on an older version which don't have that property yet in their schemas? Because in such a case you would get that error on an attempt to access a non-existing property.

So if you still know or can figure out with which version, you introduced that property, then you can just make sure that this migration enumerations only objects of schemas which have this property already.

``` swift
if (5...13).contains(oldSchemaVersion) {
  migration.enumerate(Post.className()) { oldObject, newObject in
    if let oldDateSaved = oldObject?[""dateSaved""] as? NSDate {
       newObject?[""dateSaved""] = oldDateSaved.timeIntervalSince1970 > 0 ? oldDateSaved : nil
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively you can dynamically check the `oldObject.objectSchema` to figure out whether that property already exists. This could look then like below:

``` swift
if oldSchemaVersion < 13 {
  migration.enumerate(Post.className()) { oldObject, newObject in
    guard let _ = oldObject?.objectSchema[""dateSaved""] else {
       newObject?[""dateSaved""] = nil
       return
    }
    if let oldDateSaved = oldObject?[""dateSaved""] as? NSDate {
       newObject?[""dateSaved""] = oldDateSaved.timeIntervalSince1970 > 0 ? oldDateSaved : nil
    }
  }
}
```

Would love to see support for this-- even if it is just syntactic sugar over the Box<Type> solution."
4619,Neutral,"Wanting to have overridden getters and setters for a property on unmanaged objects while still wanting the property to be persisted in Realm would be somewhat odd, but there's nothing inherently broken about it, so even if we could reliably detect this case and implicitly ignore the property it's not obvious that it would be the right thing to do."
4620,Positive,"0.97 was just released! Could you give this a try @Reggian and let us know if it's resolved?
"
4621,Neutral,"@manzoorShaikh, can you try running the following commands to force CocoaPods to re-download Realm?

```
rm -r Pods/Realm*
rm -r ~/Library/Caches/CocoaPods/Pods/Release/Realm*
pod install
```
"
4622,Neutral,"Nope not yet, was when I tried to upload a beta build so there is no pressure on this for me. Would you consider this as the next step or do you want to check the compiler thingy first?
"
4623,Neutral,"@santhoshs5 Realm object's `init(value:)` initializer can accept a KVC-compliant value that responds to all the required property keys, you can pass a managed object to the initializer to make an unmanaged copy, and vice-versa."
4624,Neutral,"I'll close this issue because it's not related Realm. If you have further questions, feel free to ask us.
"
4625,Positive,"@OlegAnghelov thanks so much for putting together this example project. The code path behind `createOrUpdate` is something that needs a good refactor (see https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/issues/1362), and that refactor should definitely address this issue. In the meantime, your best bet would be to not pass cyclical object graphs to `createInRealm` -- I know that's not ideal, but it should work as a stopgap while we fix the underlying issue.
"
4626,Neutral,"You can also try this: https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/pull/1942
You'll need to manually build until next release, but it should go through submission just fine.
"
4627,Neutral,"Ran today into the same issue (previously using 0.39 cocoapods, now --pre release). 

As suggested fixed by issuing `pod install` instead of `pod update`. Not related to any Xcode plugin but probably best practice to use `install` after major changes to CocoaPods itself.
"
4628,Neutral,"Now that fine-grained notifications are implemented, how would you do this with those notifications?"
4629,Neutral,"@bennichols your best bet will be to clone this repo and add `RealmSwift.xcodeproj` as a subproject to your own project (or workspace)

4632,Neutral,"This was mostly done in #2895. There are some complex predicates involving multi-level key paths that are not yet supported, but the `link.property > link.otherProperty` case [definitely works](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/blob/v0.103.0/Realm/Tests/QueryTests.m#L1126-L1131).
"
4633,Positive,"Thanks, I appreciate you keeping us in the loop!"
4634,Negative,"Hi @mrackwitz, sorry for not updating this issue sooner. I had to get this code working with a deadline so I ended up reworking it to create the Realm objects all at once rather than individually. I know this isn't necessarily a solution but I hope it helps someone if they run into a similar problem.

4635,Neutral,"Ah, I didn't know you could catch NSExceptions in Swift, but I [got it to work](http://stackoverflow.com/a/36454808/2597).

This is the error that occurs: `Error Domain=RLMException Code=0 ""(null)"" UserInfo={RLMRealmVersion=2.0.3, RLMRealmCoreVersion=unknown}`

can you provide a fix that works? thank you.
"
4638,Negative,"I don't think `if a user has more complex UITableView needs` is a valid argument.

When we design the database API, one should not care about the presentation of the data. Getting the low-level framework coupled with high-level module is way too weird.

Can you explain what is the `section` from the database's point of view

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41305863/real-time-sync-with-table-view-sections"
4641,Neutral,"Yes indeed, it's fairly easy to work around. Just use `.lowercaseString` when saving a copy of your string to your model, as well as when searching.

`searchAutocompleteEntriesWithSubstring(substring.lowercaseString)`

4644,Neutral,"DEFINITELY demanded.

It's great that you guys took the single-relationship option but we just swept our codebase and in fact all our sorting use-cases are ""to-many"" scenarios (and thus have to do them out of Realm / custom).

For example, our list of conversations is sorted by the last unread message. To achieve this you need to sort using SortDescriptors of first ""unread messages"" (this is a subquery), then secondly by ""messages.sentAt"".

Would sorting by SUBQUERY be yet another feature request or be handled in this 'to-many' scenario?"
4645,Neutral,"@xiaodao rather than wait for us to make a release to accommodate the non-standard compiler flags you use in your project, perhaps you could just remove those flags from your Xcode project's build settings in the meantime?"
4646,Neutral,"Hi @ehlersd, your Xcode project appears to have been incorrectly configured.

By running `pod deintegrate && pod install`, I could get everything building again. I've found that this is generally a good way to ""reset"" Xcode projects if they've been set up in a way that CocoaPods won't automatically find all its source or header files.

4647,Negative,"This should be fixed. We had a website bug that caused this for about 24 hours yesterday to this morning.
"
4648,Neutral,"that is why there is a need to be able to specify columns, which could be used as insert-update condition without specifying primary key #1473 , because in a real world primary key is not there in many cases ..may be something like:
`+ (NSArray *)uniqueKeys { return @[@""countryCode"", @""postalCode""] }` for a Geo Area
"
4649,Neutral,"You can't currently use 2 combined columns as a primary key. At the moment you can manually combine these columns and store the combined value in a third column which is primary. Using a helper method which updates both the base and combined column simultaneously can make this easier.
"
4650,Positive,"+1 This was a dealbreaker for me when evaluating Realm for use in some upcoming iOS apps.
"
4651,Positive,"Hi @vipindhangar!

Thanks for that! I think I need a little more information to work out what's going on here. It sounds like the resources from user1 aren't getting cleaned up properly before user2 comes in, causing some kind of inconsistent state.

How does user1 log out before user2 is allowed to log in? Are you able to post some code samples?

Thanks!"
4652,Positive,"Thank you very much!
"
4653,Neutral,"@kishikawakatsumi I can't say exactly how much data is actually stored, but it would make sense that we are going over realms abilities here because some of the people that are experiencing this issue have hundreds of images in their existing core data databases. "
4654,Neutral,"@michaelsand are you using Carthage 0.7.4?
"
4655,Positive,"Thanks, @crrobinson14. It looks like the exception that is being thrown is [`SlabAlloc::Retry`](https://github.com/realm/realm-core/blob/v1.5.0/src/realm/alloc_slab.cpp#L823-L829). Throwing that exception by itself shouldn't turn into a crash. Do you have a crash log that shows more details about the crash than your initial screenshot?
"
4656,Neutral,"Why not follow @tgoyne [suggestion](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/pull/3369#issuecomment-200937115) and just have it accept a single object which is either an object or a collection of objects, thus you only have to cast back into that?
"
4657,Neutral,"The cause of the error is failing to create named pipe for inter-thread and inter-process notification, though I'm in the middle of the investigation. 

Realm will create `RLMNotifier` instance when initializing itself, 
https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/blob/master/Realm/RLMRealm.mm#L450-L452

but instantiating `RLMNotifier` is failed due to `mkfifo()` (named pipe) function is not allowed on actual devices from beta2.

4660,Neutral,"Let's continue on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39741866/not-able-to-save-multiple-records-with-realm
I will re-open this issue if we find a bug in Realm.
"
4661,Neutral,"@stel  We encrypted each field before storing. Little hectic, but it works. "
4662,Neutral,"@springhand nope. I fixed a good few of my leaks by adding `[weak self]` inside all of my closures containing `self`, and checking for it. The memory leaks regarding these realm models is my only leak sources left."
4663,Neutral,"Looks like code that you're running in a Realm write transaction is throwing that exception. Realm doesn't handle exceptions thrown by your code, you have to handle those yourself.

Please keep in mind that most Objective-C frameworks don't throw exceptions as control flow or runtime handlable error reporting, but rather to indicate programmer error or API misuse, so you should instead avoid the exception being thrown rather than catching it explicitly."
4664,Neutral,":+1:
"
4665,Neutral,"This is now documented in https://realm.io/docs/objc/latest/#encryption.
"
4666,Positive,"@jpsim Thank you! I really appreciate all the help you and the other Realm peeps have given over the last few days. 
"
4667,Neutral,"Ah yes, is see. I missed this part in the docs:

> If a Realm is advanced to the latest version as part of starting a write transaction, notification handlers might be called synchronously. This will happen if, when the Realm was advanced to the latest version, Realm entities being observed were modified or deleted in a way that would trigger notifications. Such notifications will run within the context of the current write transaction, meaning attempting to begin a write transaction within the notification handler will cause Realm to throw an exception.

I understand that it is expected behavior, but is it also wanted behavior? Just curious what the usecase is.

Is calling refresh() an expensive operation when the realm is already up-to-date? Otherwise i can add an extension that always calls refresh() before starting the write-transaction.
"
4668,Positive,"Great, well that is a great catch. If you need any other info just tell me."
4669,Neutral,"Tagging as a P1 since this breaks code signatures of the frameworks when following the installation instructions for prebuilt binaries.
"
4670,Neutral,"Hi, I have similar issue. It appears not every time, only on v0.97, on 0.96.3 seems to be ok. I also noticed that it happens while serialising large JSON file to Object subclasses, but in random place during this process.

"
4671,Positive,"This seems pretty simple. I can do this in Swift 3 with the Realm Database but not with the Object Server (although I'm certain that has nothing to do with it). I have tried adding and subtracting the number of articles in my `numberOfItemsInSection` e.g. `articles -= 1`. 

This raises the exception `Left side of mutating operator isn't mutable: 'articles' is a 'let' constant`

Here's what I am trying to accomplish:

**Second VC**

     //  Write article to the realm
    func publishToRealm() {
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            let article = Article()
            self.realm = try! Realm(configuration: myConfig(user: SyncUser.current!))
            article.username = self.usernameLabel.text!
            article.text = self.editorTextView.text
            article.title = self.editorTitleTextField.text!
            try! self.realm.write {
                self.realm.add(article)
            }
        }
    }

**First VC**

These are my variables

    // Set up realm
    var realm : Realm!
    var articles : Results<Article>?
    var notificationToken: NotificationToken!

This is what I call in `viewDidLoad` e.g. `setUpRealm()`

     // Open realm using the Daily configuration
    private func setUpRealm() {
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            // Acknowledge the user and access the realm on the main thread
            self.realm = try! Realm(configuration: myConfig(user: SyncUser.current!))
            self.articles = self.realm.objects(Article.self).sorted(byKeyPath: ""created"", ascending: false)
            
            // Observe notifications and update the UI when the underlying data has been changed
            self.notificationToken = self.articles?.addNotificationBlock { [weak self] (changes: RealmCollectionChange) in
                
                guard (self?.collectionView) != nil else { return }
                
                switch changes {
                case .initial:
                    self?.collectionView.reloadData()
                    break
                    
                case .update(_, let deletions, let insertions, let modifications):
                    self?.collectionView.performBatchUpdates({
                        self?.collectionView.deleteItems(at: deletions.map({ IndexPath(row: $0, section: 0)}))
                        self?.collectionView.insertItems(at: insertions.map({ IndexPath(row: $0, section: 0)}))
                        self?.collectionView.reloadItems(at: modifications.map({ IndexPath(row: $0, section: 0)}))
                        
                    }, completion: nil)
                    break
                    
                case .error(let error):
                    print(error.localizedDescription)

4673,Positive,"Thanks @kishikawakatsumi 
"
4674,Positive,"Hi @afriedman94,

It looks like you're still having issues. It shouldn't be necessary to specify the `:git =>` option in CocoaPods.

Would you be willing to share the version of CocoaPods you're using? You can check this using the command `pod --version`.

We have a couple of CocoaPods-related troubleshooting tips in our [documentation](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#reinstalling-via-dependency-managers). In particular, you should try cleaning your build folder, and resetting your project's CocoaPods state and caches using the Terminal commands given.

Hope this helps; if you have any questions please do let us know, either in this ticket or by opening a new issue. Thanks!
"
4675,Negative,"@bmunkholm linking objects across Realms is not something that we will ever support with the given design, so it doesn't make sense to keep this open.

If users need this they can either copy objects across Realm, or they can use primary keys to reference objects across multiple Realms. Both of these scenarios are already supported in the binding.
"
4676,Neutral,"I'm having the same issue when launching my app.

`uncaught exception in notifier thread: N5realm10LogicErrorE: Bad version number`

- Realm 2.1.1 (RealmSwift/cocoapods)
- iOS 10.1
- XCode 8.1

No crash and everything is working fine. It seems to only appear once in the log."
4677,Neutral,"> For my original question - I think I have to iterate RLMArray and append each object in NSArray,

No, that also wouldn't create standalone objects. See my last comment as to why.
"
4678,Negative,"I should add that I'm sorry for the inconvenience. We generally strive to avoid breaking user code, but since this has already shipped, I find it unlikely that we'll change it back.
"
4679,Positive,"Thanks for shedding some light into this!

After some research on The Net, I stumbled across the ""rpath"" approach, but unfortunately it was to no avail.

"
4683,Neutral,"Hi @scriptedSheep, could you please share your code to help us reproduce this issue?

My first two guesses would be that there's an `RLMRealm` instance being created outside the autorelease pool, but that gets deallocated inside the pool; or that there is a bug in Realm's core.

But these are just guesses from the crash log. Seeing the code to reproduce this issue will help understand what's happening.
"
4684,Neutral,"Turns out that the exception is just thrown at one place, so that `old_version` is always greater than `new_version`. So I guess that we just swapped old and new version in the error message by accident.
"
4685,Positive,"Thanks for the help @mrackwitz , @kishikawakatsumi. A coworker of mine claimed you _could_ in previous versions (which explains why I never got this error in .8). At least, for now, you've helped me white box the problem so I know what's going on. Maybe/hopefully it's supported in future versions.

Thanks again!
"
4686,Positive,"Yeah, the initializer is probably better than the [`+initialize`](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSObject_Class/#//apple_ref/occ/clm/NSObject/initialize) method.

> What am i missing by not being able to close the Realm?

You won't be able to reset the database contents by deleting it or seed your Realm with a bundled file.
"
4687,Positive,"Thanks for the excellent reproduction case. Turns out that this is a duplicate of https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/issues/2905. There is ongoing work in PR https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/pull/2901 to fix this issue. I'll close this issue for now.
"
4688,Positive,"@BarlowTucker This one is work for me.. thank you
"
4689,Neutral,"I think the problem is `fireDateForTokenExpirationDate` returns `nil`. 

https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/blob/e44a4760337c2c70d99e54aff74047ac30540ee8/Realm/RLMSyncSessionRefreshHandle.mm#L93-L98

Is the behavior of that as intended?
"
4690,Neutral,"@phongleq @GreatApe I remember reading this elsewhere that Realm needs to have detailed notifications to support this but doesn't at the moment. Basically you just get a notification when something changed but not what changed and how (whether added, deleted, etc.). That's why the example just does a reload on receiving a notification.
"
4691,Neutral,"To avoid having data change beneath your feet in the middle of a function, we only update which version of the data an RLMRealm uses between each iteration of the runloop. Unfortunately, because GCD blocks are the highest-priority events, `dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{ ... })` immediately after a commit can result in the block being run on the main thread before our autorefresh signal, resulting in the block seeing the version of the Realm from before the commit.

You can work around this by explicitly calling `[realm refresh]` at the beginning of your block that needs to see the latest data. The more proper way would be to instead do the work in a Realm notification block rather than a dispatched block, but with the current limited notifications that'd be difficult to do.

What's happening is that when building the Realm pod, headers from the Vialer-pjsip-iOS pod are being picked up instead of Realm's headers (list.cpp does `#include ""list.hpp""` and expects to find its own list.hpp rather than one from a different directory). I'm not clear whether this is a bug in Realm's CocoaPod spec or Vialer-pjsip-iOS's CocoaPod spec, or if something else is going on. Someone more familiar with CocoaPods can probably shed some more light on this.

When you commit a write transaction on a background thread, a notification is then sent to other Realm instances on other threads (this works through a named pipe) to refresh to the latest version of the DB that includes the recently committed transaction. The problem though is that notification is processed on the receiving thread only during the default run loop mode. When you are scrolling, the main thread will run in NSEventTrackingRunLoopMode for that pass of the run loop. This means that Realm's notification will not be processed until the thread is back in default mode.

4724,Neutral,"This issue seems to be related to https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/417. It looks like a bug in `xcodebuild` where an incompatible target is picked.

I was able to work around this by changing the build command for the simulator to pick the latest OS, that's the same fix suggested for the Carthage issue.

This is the new build command in `build.sh`:

```
$cmd ""-scheme '$scheme' -configuration $config -sdk iphonesimulator ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 4s,OS=latest'""
```

That allows me to successfully build:

```
sh build.sh ios-swift
```

However, when I run: 

```
sh build.sh build
```

I run into the following error:

"
4730,Neutral,"Let me investigate it a bit more. It only happens intermittently so is tricky to reproduce. I have noticed that occasionally a client seems to ""fall behind"" and can take a few minutes to reach the same state as the ROS. For instance:

I make a change on device A.
For quite a while (sometimes up to a minute or more) there is no activity in the log.
Then suddenly a flurry of changes occurs and the other devices (including simulator and MacOS client) all synchronize.

When I make changes on all devices simultaneously, it can take a while for the sync changes to be replicated across all devices.

Now I'm wondering whether I was trying to open a Realm on a device that didn't have all the updates and it was just taking a while (2-3 minutes) to synchronize before it was opened, i.e. I might not have been patient enough.

I have about 40K objects and the changes are of the order of 20-30 rows in a table.

We can see that adding an additional level of depth doesn't surface any other crashes. Yet we also see that `List`s throw an `RLMException` about not being valid anymore. Maybe `Result`s should also throw to indicate that they are not valid anymore?

4742,Neutral,"@hhanesand this would be one of the possible approaches I mentioned:

> I thought about other approaches. For example, to store the items in the Realm with the same hierarchy used in the table view, i.e. having section realm objects that are in an ordered list and contain the list items. But this would mean I have to add a notification block to each section, where these sections of course are loaded dynamically and can be modified/deleted themselves.

I was not sure if the notification tokens work well in such dynamic scenario. It's basically the same as lists with items that can be modified/deleted themselves, but with the difference that you're using all the sections / listening to multiple notification blocks from the sections as well as the contained items at the same time. It may be that it works when I test it, but in some situations something weird happens. So I wanted to ask first. Is this recommended?

4749,Neutral,"I am also seeing this issue. If you guys would like sample screwed up realm files causing this, I can figure out how to get them. We've seen this issue happen to 70 users.

I'm hesitant to make my app respond by automatically deleting the database, just because that would suck and the data could be salvageable (for us, the realm file actually stores user curated data, and isn't a persistent cache).
"
4750,Neutral,"Closing as this is a limitation inherent to iOS and cannot be avoided outright. Please see @tgoyne's previous links for potential workarounds.
"
4751,Neutral,"You could ignore the property so it's never persisted. For example:

``` objc
@interface MyObject : RLMObject
@property NSString *presistedString;
@property NSString *memoryString;
@end
@implementation MyObject
+ (NSArray *)ignoredProperties {
  return @[@""memoryString""];
}
@end

Then you could display `memoryString` in your UI. For example, by appending a value to `persistedString`.

I'd recommend posting questions like these to the [mailing list](groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/realm-cocoa) or [StackOverflow with the `realm` tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/realm?sort=newest), since we use GitHub issues more for bugs in Realm or missing features. Thanks!

4757,Neutral,"@conradwt Hi Conrad! I'm just going through the issues here and touching base on some of the ones that haven't been followed up properly yet.

In what context would you want to uninstall Realm? Are you wanting to switch away from Realm to another library? And if so, how come?

In any case, at this point, I'm not sure if there's much to actually write in regards to 'uninstalling' Realm. Most often than not, it's simply a matter of removing the frameworks references from your app project.

4759,Neutral,"The reason why you don't get the changes you refer to, is that they are on master and not in the latest release. You'd need to use Realm from master, what you can achieve by changing your dependency in your Podfile to:

"
4761,Negative,"This issue is definitely not solved.

We are trying to adopt Realm notifications (from our previous custom mechanism) and are observing this same issue (tried in both Realm v2.5.1 and 2.7.0).

Logic seems very straight-forward:

``` Swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    // load data
    chats = try! Realm().objects( Chat.self )
    // show only ongoing chats
    .filter( ""SUBQUERY(memberStates, $memberState, $memberState.member.DAL_id == '\(User.currentUser.person.id.stringValue)' && $memberState.isArchived == false).@count > 0"" )
    .sorted( byKeyPath: ""updatedAt"", ascending: false )

    // observe changes
    plansChangedObservationToken = chats.addNotificationBlock { [weak self] (changes:RealmCollectionChange) in
        guard let chatsList:UITableView = self?.chatsList else { return }
        switch changes {
        case .initial:
            chatsList.reloadData()

        case let .update( chat, deletions, insertions, modifications ):
            chatsList.beginUpdates()
            chatsList.insertRows( at: insertions.map({ IndexPath( row: $0, section: 0 )}), with: .automatic )
            chatsList.deleteRows( at: deletions.map({ IndexPath( row: $0, section: 0 )}), with: .automatic )
            chatsList.reloadRows( at: modifications.map({ IndexPath( row: $0, section: 0 )}), with: .automatic )
            try chatsList.endUpdates()
        case .error( let error ):
            assertionFailure( ""Could not initialize chats changed Realm observation. Error: \(error)"" )
        }
    }
}
```

When our background sync does a full sync and processes all the sync operations (adding/updating/removing them from the local Realm DB) we get the following error:

Getting error:
``` 2017-05-14 17:06:07.015 Happ.Mobile[24874:1424540] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'attempt to delete row 13 from section 0 which only contains 10 rows before the update' ```

It seems the table-view gets out of sync with what is notified in the sync token.


Question 1) Is there any way to tell a realm to only fire notifications at specific times (ie: at the end of our sync loop, so that updates only get pushed up once?

Question 2) Is there some way to synchronize the table-view and the NotificationToken so that it only applies the deltas to the table-view once they've been fully applied? (it seems right now it's firing faster than the table-view is able to apply them)

We tried applying insertRows/updateRows etc. without animations ("".none"" for the last param) but it still fails in the same way."

Before we proceed, there's a few things I'd like to ask first:
- You're running on Ream 0.98.7, which is quite old at this point, and we've shipped a lot of bug fixes since then. Is there a reason why you haven't updated your copy of Realm?
- Can you please post the model definition for your `DAORealmBeer` object?
- Are you performing any checks to see if `expiredItems` actually contains any objects (i.e. `expiredItems.count > 0`) before starting a Realm transaction?

Please let me know these things as soon as you can! Thanks!

What really needs to be investigated still is whether we can support parsing models without separate `RLMObject` and `Object` subclasses of `RLMBaseObject`.

gradient pop by going extremely dark on the bottom/right edges, and kinda
light on the top/left edges, but a nice moderate hue without much shift in

to keep the R very visible in our icon, so maybe we can try something like
that, if I’m not reading the iMessage gradient wrong?

4772,Neutral,I am using collectionView with refreshControl. As i do pull refresh  I add some data to feeds. I also use realm notificationBlock for changes to get updated in collectionView but feeds(`Results<NewsFeed>`) gets updated before notification block is called which cause issues because feeds  has media(`List<Media>`) and different feeds has different media count then collectionView `cellForItemAt:` tries to access feeds media and as collectionView is not yet updated(notification block is not yet called) i get crashes.

Just started with Realm and not limit or offset? really?, and how about change listener when you only want a subset. This really sucks.
"
4776,Positive,"@alazier Thank you for the quick reply.
Adding a PK to class B doesn't work if there are objects of other classes who need to reference it.
In my scenario I would be using an OptionalString class (as described here https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/issues/628#issuecomment-56765986) and could be referenced from, say, Book and Author classes. Using a Book's PK as an OptionalString's PK at the same time as using the Author's PK as an OptionalString's PK will work only while there are no duplicate PKs in the Author and Book tables (which can't be guaranteed).
Also, if the Author has multiple properties that are OptionalStrings there's a PK clash again (that's not a 1-to-1 relationship, strictly speaking).

Probably to do this right each OptionalString property should be of some different class, like AuthorName or BookName, which both descend from OptionalString. But that means creating new classes not because they're logically needed, but because of implementation intricacies. Kind of violates the Occam's Razor principle, if you see what I mean.
"
4777,Neutral,The instructions were followed but the issue only started to happen in realm 2.2 ~ 2.4 version.
4778,Positive,@ashhanai could you please provide an example xcode project/code sample in order to reproduce this case? Thanks!
4779,Neutral,"Although it's possible that having the Realm Browser open while you perform operations on the Realm in your app could be at fault, that scenario is generally something that Realm supports.

Again, a repro case would be very useful in digging into what's happening here.
"
4780,Neutral,"Why do you need this? If you want to delete an object in your current schema, you should have the class type to be able to pass to it:

``` swift
func delete(type: Object.Type, id: Int) {
     // Get the default Realm
     let realm = try! Realm()
     let queryResult = realm.objects(type).filter(""id = %@"", id)
     try! realm.write {
         realm.delete(queryResult)
     }
}
```

If you don't have the model class available, is it because you're in a migration and the class may no longer exist? In that case, you should be using [`Migration.deleteData(forType:)`](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/api/Classes/Migration.html#/s:FC10RealmSwift9Migration10deleteDataFT7forTypeSS_Sb):

``` swift
// in migration block:
migration.deleteData(forType: ""RemovedClassName"")
```

If you want to expose functionality in your app where you don't know which model should be deleted, you can use Realm's dynamic API to do this:

``` swift
func delete(typeName: String, id: Int) {
     // Get the default Realm
     let realm = try! Realm()
     let queryResult = realm.dynamicObjects(typeName).filter(""id = %@"", id)
     try! realm.write {
         realm.delete(queryResult)
     }
}

4782,Neutral,"I guess since the mutable counterparts are subclasses, not need to support them. The user could simply create a mutable copy after handover.
"
4783,Neutral,"What we really wan is a general key/value store interface. This was part of the original design but didn't make it in for launch. You can see one of its intended purposes here: https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/blob/master/Realm/RLMRealm.h#L276

The interface in the headers can easily be used by users of the api to store custom table/column metadata as follows:

4794,Neutral,"I originally was creating my objects with out a primary key and parsing updates for my objects from my returned JOSN from the server. I would then apply these updates with out discrimination and noticed way to many `modifications` being passed through in my `addNotificationBlock` (On a  `List<Object>` of the highest level objects in my data graph). My fault I told myself. I went and changed all my realm objects to have a primary key and passed updates using the `realm.add(self, update: true)` method. 

I was still getting all the notifications!! I'm glad I found this thread. I simply stopped reloading my `UITableViewCell`'s and I can manage the ~3 second spike of CPU usage. When reloading the `UITableViewCell`'s the CPU was pegged at 100% for a few seconds. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I would love it if Realm did actually only send notifications for actual changes. If not, I guess I can propagate my own custom notifications on the server sync's."

4797,Positive,"I've run our unit tests in a number of configurations without being able to reproduce the issue. Tests were run on Xcode 7 beta 4 with an ""All Exceptions"" breakpoint and ""Address Sanitizer"" enabled.
1. iOS 9 beta 4 on an iPhone 6
2. iOS 7.0.3 on an iPhone 5S
3. iOS 8.1.3 on an iPhone 5

Given the circumstances in which Address Sanitizer detected a _potential_ issue in combination with the ""All Exceptions"" breakpoint, I'd say this was probably a false positive and I wouldn't worry too much about it. As soon as you start catching exceptions in Objective-C code that isn't compiled to be safe with exceptions, you'll start seeing some funny behavior.

So in light of this, I'm closing the issue. If you can provide us a reproducible scenario affecting ""normal"" development (without Address Sanitizer or All Exceptions breakpoint), we'll reopen and address it.

4806,Neutral,"The SHA value logged in revisions.log is captured from the output of `git rev-parse --short HEAD` run on the remote repository. The value this command outputs will normally be the hash of the head of the master branch, assuming that the contents of `repo/HEAD` haven't been changed by the user. If capistrano is configured to deploy a different branch using `set :branch, 'production'` (say) then the SHA value logged in revisions.log will not be the hash of the head of the specified branch, it will be the hash of the head of the master branch.

The staging branch is deployed correctly because the `git archive staging` command names the branch, but the SHA in the log message (`24a9bf2`) is the SHA for the master branch.

This is using capistrano 3.1.0, capistrano-rails 3.1.1, capistrano-bundler 1.1.1.
"
4807,Neutral,"Right now the implementation of the `repo_url` helper method has some special logic that is Git-specific. It looks for the presence of `:git_http_username` and `:git_http_password` and uses these to mutate the original `:repo_url`.

From `dsl/paths.rb`:

``` ruby
def repo_url
  require ""cgi""
  require ""uri""
  if fetch(:git_http_username) && fetch(:git_http_password)
    URI.parse(fetch(:repo_url)).tap do |repo_uri|
      repo_uri.user     = fetch(:git_http_username)
      repo_uri.password = CGI.escape(fetch(:git_http_password))
    end.to_s
  elsif fetch(:git_http_username)
    URI.parse(fetch(:repo_url)).tap do |repo_uri|
      repo_uri.user = fetch(:git_http_username)
    end.to_s
  else
    fetch(:repo_url)
  end
end
```

This is a handy feature, but I believe this is the wrong place to implement it. It should live in the Git SCM plugin.

Since we eventually want to move all SCM implementations out of core and into separate plugins, this code will need to be moved as well. I suggest we do this after #1572 is merged.

4808,Positive,"I just set up capistrano and was wondering why my cap tasks were not working. I got the error message ""Stage not set, please call something such as `cap production deploy`, where production is a stage you have defined."" (https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/blob/master/lib/capistrano/i18n.rb#L11). I was not in the root directory of my application, so Capistrano would not find my stages. I think the error message can be missleading and I suggest to include something like: ""Make sure to be in your root directory."" I can do a pull request if you like to. Just close this issue, if you think this wouldn't improve anything :)

$ bundle exec gem list |grep cap
capistrano (3.1.0)
capistrano-bundler (1.1.2)
capistrano-rvm (0.1.1
```

I use capistrano to fire up an old version of resque through rake that has some deprecation warnings to STDERR.  

Here's the whole task:

```
  desc 'Restart worker'
  task :resque_restart do
    on roles(:web) do
      fetch(:resque_num_workers).times do |i|
        pid_file = File.join(fetch(:deploy_to), ""web_work_#{i}.pid"")
        execute ""if [ -e #{pid_file} ]; then echo 'Killing resq'; kill -s QUIT `cat #{pid_file}`; rm -f #{pid_file}; fi;""
        within current_path do
          with rack_env: fetch(:rack_env), interval: 5, pidfile: pid_file, queue: fetch(:resque_queue), background: 'yes' do
            execute :rake, 'resque:work', ""-r ./web.rb >> #{fetch(:resque_logfile)} &""
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
```

This generates the command here in the logs, which works fine on the console:

```
cd /home/atweb/deployer/current && ( RACK_ENV=production INTERVAL=5 PIDFILE=/home/atweb/deployer/web_work_1.pid QUEUE=deploy BACKGROUND=yes ~/.rvm/bin/rvm default do bundle exec rake resque:work -r ./web.rb >> log/resque.log & )
```

Cap finishes all with 0/successful exit codes, but the resque workers get killed off somehow despite any combination of nohup and & to make them survive a cap deployment.  

The trick that finally made the resque workers survive for good was replacing the `>> log/resque.log` in the above with `&>> log/resque.log` to capture both stderr and stdin and redirect it to the log.  

What's going on here?

Updated to latest cap version

Capistrano Version: 3.6.0 (Rake Version: 11.2.2)
ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26 revision 54768) [x86_64-darwin15]

Got 1 project where I have password auth.

4822,Neutral,"What is the proper way to `deploy:setup` and to do a cold deploy with Capistrano?

Using Capistrano v2.14.2 and Vagrant to virtualize my server, this is my scenario:
1. when running `deploy:setup`, Capistrano makes use of root privileges to prepare the directory structure for deployment
2. yet upon `deploy:cold` Capistrano attempts to checkout (from git in this case) and write as the `vagrant` user – the user specified in `deploy.rb`
3. Of course, the `deploy:check` report bares no surprises: the `vagrant` user cannot write in the directories created during `deploy:setup` since the two users belong to different groups – `root:root` versus `vagrant:vagrant`

_Note:_ For output listing, and other details, please check [the sister-question on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/q/15144815/341929).

What is the reasoning behind this, and what prerequisite is not satisfied yet so the deployment passes this issue?  
Is there any elegant way to make this work, or is SSH-ing in and changing the permissions manually the way to go?

2. set :branch variable as correct git tag
3. While deploy capistrano throws error
#### Expected behaviour

Capistano should use git tag as git branch name and should deploy application give tag
I suppose that there is hard written ""origin"" word in class Capistrano::Git < Capistrano::SCM at the update method:

```
def update
      # Note: Requires git version 1.9 or greater
      if (depth = fetch(:git_shallow_clone))
        git :fetch, ""--depth"", depth, ""origin"", fetch(:branch)
      else
        git :remote, :update, ""--prune""
      end
    end
```

Should be also ""tags"" while tag is given.

However, if i manually run the exact same command as capistrano (first line of the previous output) via ssh, the same output appears and the server works correctly.

Additionally, if i remote the `-d` option from the capistrano task, thus not running in daemon mode, it also works (although capistrano hangs waiting for it, obviously)

So the problem seems to only happen when starting it via capistrano, and only when using daemon mode.

The gist of it is that I must use :deploy_via :copy, and at least when using git as the scm, that causes cap to chain the clone, cd and checkout commands with && operators. This does not work in Windows (at least not when using jRuby and msysgit). Whether or not it is invoked from e.g. cygwin makes no difference. It'd be great if the chaining could be done in some other way so I wouldn't have to spin up a VM just to deploy from.

Problem can be solved by changing the deploy_to path to the full path (/var/www/.../rails) but I think ""~/rails"" should still work as we don't want to change our deploy_to variable for each project where we decide to update capistrano.

4841,Neutral,"Hello,

I'm trying to run my first deploy and when the capistrano come on this step, it stop and don't continue. I have waited for 30, 40, 50 minutes and nothing...

Is there some way to know what is happening ?

It does not return any exception, error message, nothing, only ''stop'' and don't finished.

I'm using rails 3.2.3 and Capistrano v2.13.5. I'm trying to use a Amazon ec2 instance. The enviroment is seted up to another one similar application e work, so i can't stand why it is not working for this app.

Any tips are welcome, thanks!

What if we could make a tool like `capify`, but more intellectual?

I've made [capistrano-wizard](https://github.com/kirs/capistrano-wizard), tool that asks about plugins (rails/bundler/rvm/etc) you're going to use and on which stages and hosts you're going to deploy.

As a result, this tool generates the same files as `capify`, but with specific plugins and options enabled for individual configuration the developer needs.

What do you think about it?
I'm not sure if this should be part of Capistrano at all, but it might be useful for newbies.

I have segmentation fault when doing `cap deploy`. 
It first occured while capistrano tried execute command `RAILS_ENV=production script/delayed_job stop -m;`, so I thought it is delayed job issue. But when I removed delayed job from deploy.rb, I got segmentation fault when executing `git clone`.

Does someone know if this is capistrano related problem? What is strange - my teammates, with very similar enviroments don't get this error. 

I am on osx 10.7.2, capistrano 2.9.0, ruby 1.9.3, bundler 1.1rc

4854,Negative,"I don't see the use-case personally, if you're doing some API calls to look up roles, then you can easily do that up-front, for one or many machines, if you want to lazy evaluate it, that sounds a bit contrived (i.e wait until you're in the middle of something important, before risking reliance on a 3rd party server.)

We'd take a patch, if you wanted to write one, all the code along these paths is relatively simple, and well tested and robust, but I don't see myself implementing it, sorry.

4858,Negative,"Another update,  I've attempted to solve it by creating a ""capistrano"" user group and add all the ""deploying"" users to it and gave that group `g+wrx` permission on `/tmp/git-ssh.sh` but then capistrano decides it wants to CHANGE the permissions of the file...

```
DEBUG Uploading /tmp/git-ssh.sh 0.0%
 INFO Uploading /tmp/git-ssh.sh 100.0%
 INFO [e643f41f] Running /usr/bin/env chmod +x /tmp/git-ssh.sh on mccme-web.msbb.uc.edu

DEBUG [e643f41f]    chmod: changing permissions of `/tmp/git-ssh.sh'
DEBUG [e643f41f]    : Operation not permitted

I mean, I get why it needs it to be owned by the user so that the files that ""git"" pulls down don't get owned by the root:capistrano but still... just wish I could find an alternative solution.

Back to the drawing board again...

Interesting :) Let's keep this ticket then, it's tagged correctly at least and we can figure out what to do with the ""Why does something work in SSH but not Capistrano"" page of the docs, and maybe something on the website/readme about how we interact with the shell, unrelated to people who're debugging.

As a rule I've always used a deploy user, and done the user/groups/umask dance so that the deploy user can share with others in his group, then personal shell init files are never in the scene as far as Capistrano is concerned."

"
4866,Neutral,"@leehambley @seenmyfate are you ok with this proposal?
"
4867,Positive,"I think I did also write the code for `assets_manifest.yml`, and that was solely to handle rollbacks. When you only store the `asset_manifest.yml` files in the release directories, they get deleted whenever the release is cleaned up. This is a problem, because it's very possible to cycle through all your releases (e.g. 5) well before your assets expiry time, such as the default of 2 weeks. So as soon as you clean up the release, all of the unique assets in that file are going to be deleted. My ideal solution was to keep timestamped asset manifests in a separate shared directory, where their timestamp is set to the _last_ time they were deployed. That means that the manifest file generated during the previous deploy would have the same timestamp as the current release, because that was the last time that those assets were being served to web browsers. If all of this is in place, then we can just delete any manifests with a timestamp older than 2 weeks (for example), and your assets will always be expired correctly, no matter how many releases you keep, how many times you deploy, or how frequently you deploy.

So those are the edge cases that aren't handled by the backed up manifest solution. They are handled by the mtime solution, but that turned out to be terribly slow. 

Great work on the Rails 4 assets support, btw!
"
4868,Neutral,"I'm not sure this is a bug, but you are right that the way Capistrano and DropletKit are designed are inherently conflicting.

Capistrano does add its DSL to all object. Normally in Capistrano's universe this isn't a problem, since Capistrano is usually used as a standalone tool and not in combination with other libraries or with application code.

I'm not sure we can do much about it, as altering how the Capistrano DSL is defined is probably a big breaking change.

In your case specifically, if you aren't using the DSL `delete` method, you could remove it. Try this before your DropletKit code is executed (e.g. at the bottom of your Capfile):

``` ruby
Capistrano::DSL::Env.send(:remove_method, :delete)
```

4877,Neutral,"There seems to be some miscommunication here. The Rake docs specify that **stderr** is the default. 

> --trace{=output} (-t)
> Turn on invoke/execute tracing. Also enable full backtrace on errors. The output parameter is optional, but if specified it controls where the trace output is sent. If output is stdout, then trace output is directed to standard output. **If `output` is stderr, or if it is missing, then trace output is sent to standard error.**

Capistrano is not deviating from this.

4878,Neutral,"Maybe the properly question is:

How to use capistrano to run `bundle list` with a seperate traveling-ruby (independent the ruby which is used in project), anywhy, capistrano just a deployment tools, it should run any shell command as use with
shell, right? as following:

```sh
x=$(bundle list)
# or x=`bundle list`
echo ""$x""
```

use with shell, it always work.

"
4879,Positive,"First of all, thanks for such a prompt response. I really appreciate the help. 

The other thing i said, it's not actually related to capistrano, but more to rake gem

i have another project: https://github.com/bogdanRada/capistrano_multiconfig_parallel and i was trying to show progress of tasks while they are running in parallel, but in order to do that i run them with option ""--dry-run"" first to save the invocation chain  for each worker and then while they are executing i can show progress.

However now I  discovered this bug with '--dry-run' that actually runs the tasks, and i can't really do this using current version (because that will execute some of the tasks on server)  

So if i revert completely the patch or use my patch and try to run this command:

```
 bundle exec cap ghcp-api:development deploy --dry-run --trace
```

 I get only this output and then it stops:

```
** Invoke ghcp-api:development (first_time)
** Execute (dry run) ghcp-api:development
** Invoke deploy (first_time)
** Invoke gitflow:verify_up_to_date (first_time)
** Execute (dry run) gitflow:verify_up_to_date
** Execute (dry run) deploy
```

But probably this thing with rake and hooks is most likely a bug in rake gem or something . So you can
deconsider this afirmation:

> However what is annoying is that having this option set to true, it does not follow the invocation chain
> of the task , but that is something that can be fixed in rake gem i think

4895,Positive,"Since Capistrano just uses SSH to call out to Rails, let's assume it's a Rails problem.

One thing you might try is 

```
set(:pty, false)
```

As early as feasible in your cap scripts to avoid the chance that your dotfiles are causing weird environmental issues.

You might also try appending (see the docs, I don't have them handy) `LC_ALL=C` to the default environment for Capistrano.

Otherwise go back to your Chef/Puppet/whatever you are using recipes, and try and figure out why your machines have been provisioned with different locales.

Please reference the Rails issue here when you've opened it so we can track the resolution.

"
4899,Positive,"> ... I don't see the use-case myself, ...

When I created this feature request our deployment strategy was different than it currently is.

By that time we used to use a single role for everything and we wanted to specify the hooks ourselves depending on which environment and application to load but simply requiring the gems in Capfile would activate all hooks.

Currently we no longer set up the roles in config/deploy.rb but we conditionally set up the roles depending on the environment and application so that it doesn't matter if the hook was installed since we stopped using `on(:all)` blocks.

The gems we use (bundler, rails, sidekiq) don't use `on(:all)` blocks with automatic hooks, so we're fine with the current Capistrano state currently. I can still think that this feature might be used for some gem possibly, but I'd prefer to have a real use-case scenario well defined before implementing such feature in a patch to avoid bloating Capistrano's source code.

I'll close this ticket for now and if I find myself needing it again I'll reopen the issue and implement some patch if you agree with the approach.

We currently use a mix of Capistrano and Chef to deploy to our environments. It was similar to this a while ago, but it went through some changes after I created this repository:

https://github.com/rosenfeld/capistrano-chef-deployment

This was created for an article I've written about the approach:

https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/part-1-managing-multiple-apps-and-environments-capistrano-3-and-chef-solo (part 2 hasn't been published yet I guess - formatting and code highlighting is not enabled in this article, but this is out of my control)

Previously we had been using Capistrano more like this:

https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/part-1-managing-multiple-apps-and-environments-capistrano-3-and-chef-solo
https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/part-2-deploying-multiple-applications-capistrano-single-project

Currently our deployment strategy consists of a single ""app"" Capistrano environment and we use something like spec=server_environment_app to decide what to do in the Capistrano side. Capistrano will then run Chef possibly in multiple servers (the database server, the proxy server and every server involved in the process) before running the application's Capistrano recipes (in the deploy:full task).

We don't currently need to patch Capistrano in any way to achieve that goal. Thank you for your great product :)

"
4907,Neutral,"Hi @BenjaminKim the formatters (take a look) for Capistrano live in SSHKit, mostly - and they take a standard `IO` - typically this is set to $stdout, but you could easily wrap $stdout in something else that responds to `#write`, and keeps a copy. The formatters don't always receive plain strings, they receive `Command` objects, and whatever else, and they make decisions about how to print them, you might take a look at https://github.com/mattbrictson/airbrussh for some inspiration, although you wouldn't have to go anywhere near that far, simply keep a copy of each thing that is written to your output, and then do something with it to render it for the user. That might mean that you do the same thing (mostly, just call `.to_s` on everything you receive, or you might want to do something cleverer, to make it into HTML or strip the colours/formatting for email display.

"
4913,Neutral,"@patricknelson Yes, there is a place for you to add custom Capistrano tasks to your project, usually {Rails.root}/lib/capistrano/tasks/ -- look at the end of your Capfile.  Take the entirety of the code I posted above (minus the `set :optional_linked_files, ...` part that goes in config/deploy.rb) and put it in a file under that directory (such as lib/capistrano/tasks/optional_linked_files.rake)."
4914,Neutral,"Perhaps the solution here is to, at most, add the following lines to the default `deploy.rb`:

```ruby
# Uncomment the following to require manually verifying the host key before first deploy.
# set :ssh_options, verify_host_key: :secure
```"
4915,Positive,"@leehambley This is the results I got from that checkit task

```
server_1_ip_address, app, web, basic_work_q_tender
server_2_ip_address, delayed_job, search
```

Seeing that I don't see the db role that is the problem right? Do I basically need to merge lines 1 and 2 from my example above to fix it? If so line 2 has the primary true flag set. Is that legacy or is that still needed?

Thanks again for your support here.
"
4916,Positive,"@j15e Please feel free to modify the wiki, that's why it's a wiki :)
"
4917,Neutral,"> @leehambley Do you know if there is software which allows us to track (ideally on a paragraph by paragraph level) which parts of the docs changed, and throw them in a queue for translation? It'd be nice to have the docs translated, and perhaps it would be doable if it was easy to mark which sections were up to date and help translate them…

The only thing I've seen is Git backed book authorship tools
"
4918,Neutral,"I'm using version 2.12.0, but I can't seem to get this code working.  to my eyes it looks like it should, but am I missing something? I'm just doing as above, assigning assets role to :app in my case.
"
4919,Positive,"Actually, apart from this one issue which I'm happy enough to continue working around, it works fine here. Perhaps the fact that we've already moved to a system backed by ACLs, where we can deploy as ourselves rather than the shared user running Rails, has made this work better than it might have otherwise.

We were deploying remotely but have just switched to `:local` because our new environment is very locked down and we only allow SSH access from one specific access machine. We could deploy from there but it made more sense to pull our Capistrano files onto the target, which already has Ruby installed and already has access to the git server. The initial setup is done by Chef so all we have to do is jump on there and basically run `bundle install; cap deploy`.

I didn't consider Rake or Thor because Capistrano, whether local or remote, does exactly what we need it to do out of the box. This is a Rails application so it handles the assets and migrations, but even for our non-Rails stuff, it intelligently deploys each release whilst dealing with RVM and Bundler. I don't want to give that up! It's true that we are not using the multi-server aspect of it, beyond having multiple stages, but that's only a small part of the larger package.

I'm not aware of the reasons why you want to remove `:local` but if I come across any issues, I'll do my best to fix them myself.
"
4920,Neutral,"I'm looking on the master branch: https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/blob/master/lib/capistrano/logger.rb#L99

(We're using 2.13.5, fwiw)
"
4921,Neutral,"Closing because I’m not sure this is an issue, if you are convinced that this is really a bug, please feel free to re-open the issue and add more information (your versions (Ruby, Cap, etc), your Capfile, your logs, and relevant sections out of your Gemfile)

Otherwise support is done via the mailing list (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/capistrano) or at StackOverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/capistrano) with questions tagged `capistrano`.
"
4922,Neutral,"Finally, I see in your logs that your `git` command is different than mine. Yours is:

```
git fetch --depth 1 origin ...
```

Whereas mine is:

```
git remote update --prune
```

Based on the Capistrano source, I can deduce that you are have this in your configuration:

```
set :git_shallow_clone, 1
```

Correct?

Furthermore, when I look at the code, there is a comment that says:

> Note: Requires git version 1.9 or greater

But you are running 1.8.3.1.

Could that be the problem?

The code looks like this:

https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/blob/e27b0322f2e84104023d64dd6e63436a15ca7c91/lib/capistrano/git.rb#L31-L38

``` ruby
def update
  # Note: Requires git version 1.9 or greater
  if (depth = fetch(:git_shallow_clone))
    git :fetch, ""--depth"", depth, ""origin"", fetch(:branch)
  else
    git :remote, :update, ""--prune""
  end
end
```
"
4923,Positive,"Unless I'm missing something, with the way Capistrano currently works, the only way to reliably get the previous deploy is by reading/parsing `revisions.log`. There's no way to do it through the mirrored `repo` clone since Cap is using `git archive` to create a new release.

So if parsing `revisions.log` is the acceptable solution, I can give it a shot. Although it may not be done too quickly :)
"
4924,Neutral,"Unless you have a good reason not to do so, yes. If you write commands with spaces in their names the complexity for correct shell escaping goes through the roof, imagine the example:

``` ruby
within release_path do
    execute ""rm -rf some file""
end
```

Its impossible to know which spaces should be escaped (probably the user meant to type `some\ file`, or `'some file'`), and which should not (the spaces around the `-rf`)

For that reason, if people wish to use spaces in their commands, they are free to do something like this:

``` ruby
execute <<-EOCOMMAND
  (
    cd #{release_path};
    pwd && ls;
  )
EOCOMMAND
```

We (the core team) are of the opinion that our decision makes sense, although admittedly from outside it's not immediately clear the reasoning behind that.
"
4925,Neutral,"@leehambley On looking at the code there are tests in place for this and they also refer to 'role' and 'host', so it was a doc error. Although I'm tempted to change the names to 'roles' and 'hosts' to fit in with the command line and ENV names, doing so would break existing usage. How about we allow both? I'll create a PR that just makes this addition, then we can leave the documentation unchanged, and existing users won't break.
"
4926,Neutral,"Still happening to me as well on version 3.2.1, current fix is to load in a backwards order.
"
4927,Neutral,"@kbruneel  You can also use Connection sharing... http://protempore.net/~calvins/howto/ssh-connection-sharing/ has a how-to.

Basically, ssh connects once and leaves the connection hanging around for a while.  If you try connecting again, it reuses the same connection.

You can set it to something short like `10m` for example and it'll prevent UFW from getting upset.
"
4928,Neutral,"Yeah, using:

set :assets_role, [:web, :app, :worker]

Fixed the problem for me - I just think that should be the default.

Ian
"
4929,Neutral,"@leehambley I can't speak for @siannopollo but we use the tinder gem during deploys which loads ActiveSupport.
"
4930,Positive,"Sure, send me a PR with your suggestion, I'd be more than happy to merge it in :) (as maintainer I never know where is logical with putting information in the docs, as I knew it all anyway :-D)
"
4931,Positive,"@cgriego Any news? :) What are the problems you are facing?
"
4932,Neutral,"Duplicate at #1545 where we'll fix this, see the newly linked issue there.
"
4933,Negative,"@clintonb If you're here to troll me because you have a problem with my management style, don't bother.
"
4934,Positive,"> with something like:

uniquetmpdir = capture(""mktemp -d --tmpdir=#{fetch(:tmp_dir)} #{fetch(:application)}XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"")

That might be reasonable, but it leaves scripts hanging around after the deploy, unless the bash ssh script is extended to remove itself with a trap, but then it's not reliable for all git operations, and we'd have to upload a new one every time we perform a git operation.

There's a good reason that it's the way it is now, it's a compromise for which we didn't yet find a better solution.

If you have the time to play around, and try and come up with something we didn't think of, I'd be glad of it!
"
4935,Neutral,"@finkelm We are doing our best to improve the docs, with a big recent push to the README and to [capistranorb.com](http://capistranorb.com).

I know that your concern is with the SSHKit DSL specifically, which we haven't written much about (yet). So this issue isn't ""done"" by any means. I'm going to move it to the https://github.com/capistrano/documentation repository where it is better suited.

price isn't too high... (@matt, what command did you use to merge them?)

"
4937,Positive,"Thank @niklas!  Worked for me.
"
4938,Neutral,"We use .cap, the same way as Rake uses .rake, which is also a bit weird.
I'm sure that we could also look for .rb files, or .rake files. Can you not
train your IDE?

We specify the files to load in the Capfile, see the example
`./lib/capistrano/templates/Capfile` in the repository, which ends up as
your main Capfile, which has the line:

Dir.glob('lib/capistrano/tasks/*.cap').each { |r| import r }

The `import` line is kind of important, as that refers to loading files as
""task sources"" as against just parsing them as Ruby, but you could easily
change that if it doesn't suit your env, We might even be able to change
the globbing pattern to something like 'lib/capistrano/tasks/*.cap{,.rb}'

I'm having trouble thinking through all the implications, this stuff is confusing.

Aww, sad, it seemed like such a magic solution. But you're probably right. This stuff is confusing, i can't quite wrap my head around all the cases.

4960,Neutral,"Unfortunately even if you are willing to restrict yourself to deploying from the same OS as your target you have to develop a custom strategy to make this work. `set :build_script, 'bundle package'` does not suffice because bundler will run in your current environment instead of packaging in the `:copy_dir`.

An example gem that creates a custom strategy to work around this problem can be found here: https://github.com/rainux/capistrano-strategy-copy-with-bundle-package

If the `:build_script` approach provided more control over the sub-shell environment the script is executed in or if there was a way to hook in to the build step (if build were more like a task for example) it would be a lot simpler to integrate `bundle package` into a deployment.

If you still are having problems after working through the guide, I would suggest asking for some help from the awesome people of the [cap google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/capistrano).

Yes, Capture is designed to run that way, sorry for the surprise, you'd be better writing something like:

```
run('if [ -e #{pid_file} ] then; #{try_sudo} #{kill} $(cat #{pid_file}) ;fi')
```

That's the only workaround (i.e. let the server do the work to capture the pid)

So, is it inadvisable to use capistrano for anything other than deploys? The docs certainly tout capistrano as a generic automation tool.

But this sounds like a fatal flaw for an automation tool (from [the docs](http://capistranorb.com/documentation/getting-started/rollbacks/)):

> when a task fails on one server by exiting with a non-0 exit code, Capistrano closes the SSH connections to any still in-progress servers and their tasks exit.

This seems crazy. I don't see how tasks can be designed such that they would leave their systems in a consistent state no matter which of their individual commands was aborted and killed in the middle of execution. If only there were some mechanism to run command X to clean up state when command Y fails.

I swear I must be missing something. Am I asking the wrong question? Imagine if databases had no transactional support and would leave any update query half-applied if it hit an error.

to the following:

```

    from /Users/wuboy/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.0/bin/cap:23:in `<main>'

The fix is simply remove exit_because_of_exception method in lib/capistrano/application.rb

```
    def exit_because_of_exception(ex)
      if deploying?
        exit_deploy_because_of_exception(ex)
      else
        super
      end
    end
```

capistrano will call super exit_because_of_exception wiithout using deploying? method.
After that, capistrano give me understandable message now.

```

/Users/wuboy/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.0/bin/cap:23:in `<main>'
```

That message made me realize that syntax has been changed between 2.\* and 3.\* .
So, for those who still use old capistrano syntax. The fix will be just sticky capistrano gem version to 2.*.

```
gem 'capistrano', :github => ""capistrano/capistrano"", :tag => ""2.15.5""
```

You should also uninstall 3.\* capistrano gem because cap command may still refer to 3.*.

```
gem uninstall capistrano
Select gem to uninstall:
 1. capistrano-3.1
 2. capistrano-2.15.5
 3. All versions
> 1
```

Everything is back now.

My understanding from that [article you linked to](http://capistranorb.com/documentation/advanced-features/ptys/), (which I had read before), was by setting `:pty` to `true`, this should make the session 'interactive', and allow me to provide the input. This was the OPs understanding too:

Is this your understanding? Or would you still expect this not to work even if after calling `set :pty, true`?

To be clear, this doesn't work. The password I type is echoed on screen, but it doesn't get passed to the server, and the execution doesn't continue.

The [gem](https://github.com/kentaroi/sshkit-sudo) I linked to fixes this issue and allows the password to be captured, and execution continues as expected.

I'm really not sure about this, but the error may come from the fact that ruby 1.8.6 does not accept blocks arguments with define_method. This code only works in 1.8.7 and 1.9 :

``` ruby
class ExampleClass
  define_method(:sample_method) {|&b| b.call } 
end
```

Whereas 1.8.6 will raise a SyntaxError.
If this is the same error encoutered in Capistrano the code may be refactored using class_eval, though I'm not sure what this code even does.

Then again, as 1.8.6 is already obsolete, maintaining compatibility may not be worth the extra work and simply specifying a required ruby version in the README is a lot easier.

5003,Neutral,"Just to clarify:

> main deploy.rb file common to all stages in config/deploy.rb and various stages in the config/deploy dir

^ This is still the standard practice for Capistrano 3.

What I was describing as problematic is when you put the `deploy.rb` _inside_ the stages directory:

`config/deploy/deploy.rb` <-- bad
"
5004,Neutral,"I got the workaround from the git task source: [lib/capistrano/tasks/git.rake#L25](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/blob/master/lib/capistrano/tasks/git.rake#L25)
Is this the recommended way of doing this or should there be a better/more convenient way?
"
5005,Neutral,"Hi @nicolas-bastien that's pretty much the gist of it indeed. You should just be able to `require_relative ../` from `Capfile` or `deploy.rb` to anywhere for your file to be loaded. If not, ping me back and maybe I can help.
"
5006,Positive,"Thanks for the feedback @robd. We discussed a lot whether a little configuration was better than some implicit magic, and settled upon clarity through explicit definition vs. magical inference of the should-be settings.

5007,Positive,"@leehambley I completely agree with both statements.  I also agree with @greinacker that `:db_migrations` seems a little clearer when in the context of the `role` definition.

I do still feel that there are times when tasks need to be run directly on the DB server, however since you can manually specify roles, this may be an exercise for the user to define on an 'as needed' basis.

"
5010,Positive,"Sure, I'd love to answer any questions.
1. From the docs: Assets are shared across deploys to avoid mid-deploy mismatches between old application html asking for assets and getting a 404 file not found error. This is because deploying a new release does not guarantee that the previous assets won't be requested any more. (Maybe a browser has some cached html which references the old asset.)
2. This is what I've just been working on. Assets are currently fully recompiled on each run, and I've just finished the feature to only recompile changed assets based on their source fingerprints. See https://github.com/ndbroadbent/turbo-sprockets-rails3 and https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails/pull/21. This is the main reason I've been fixing up assets for Capistrano.
3. Because my pull requests have not yet been merged :)
4. Yes, which is what I'm solving in #281 
5. #281 does not address #227 (skip if no changes to assets), it only addresses #210 (rollback of cap deploy:assets uses newest assets). However, it also adds a feature to clean up unneeded assets so your `shared/assets` directory doesn't keep growing out of control. I've addressed #227 with pull requests to `sprockets-rails` and `sprockets` (solving the problem at the source), as well as reasing my [turbo-sprockets-rails3](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/turbo-sprockets-rails3) gem.
"
5011,Neutral,"The problem is clearly listed, your repository already contains a `config/database.yml` and therefore linking it from the shared folder (it's probably configured with a `linked_file` directive somewhere)

You appear to have defined your server there twice, but as you've censored the posting I can't be sure, so they are racing against each other to link the database yml.
"
5012,Neutral,"Here's a workaround for capistrano v2: http://stackoverflow.com/a/19251695/162793
"
5013,Neutral,"There is a [bug in capistrano-rails](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/pull/699#issuecomment-26398382) that will be fixed soon, but for now you can replace 

``` ruby
require 'capistrano/rails/assets'
require 'capistrano/rails/migrations'
```

with

``` ruby
require 'capistrano/rails'
```

And `rails_env` will be filled automatically.
"
5014,Neutral,"You can't at the moment, but if you could, it'd be a feature we pulled into [capistrano/sshkit](https://github.com/capistrano/sshkit/)
"
5015,Neutral,"Works if credentials are pushed into the repo URL, but that also works on Cap 2 so seems there's no real benefit of using Cap 3 on HTTPS?

**UPDATE**: the benefit is the possibility to use special characters in the password.
"
5016,Neutral,"@jwensley2 another solution to use next feature of capistrano:

``` ruby
set :linked_dirs, fetch(:linked_dirs) + %w{craft/storage}
```

or 

``` ruby
set :linked_dirs, %w{public/assets/uploads craft/storage}
```

And you would not require to create the directory by own self. And the storage folder would be one and shared among to other revisions.
"
5017,Neutral,"Probably https://github.com/capistrano/sshkit/commit/711c7aa30ca606a33d36bd90848c4cc7be69f8bb, or perhaps pm2 is confused. Seems like nothing in Capistrano but rather SSHKit. 

I'll close this here, because all the connection handling/etc is done by SSHKit for Capistrano, and the formatting and printing, as well.

Maybe you could check that pm2 haven't changed something in the meantime (since that looks like) output has changed. Or at least attach your logs to the ticket, that I'd like to ask you to open with sshkit.
"
5018,Neutral,"> IMO, it's pretty critical because asset mtimes are not being touched. That causes deploy:assets:clean_expired to remove required assets.

So everyone using 2.x to deploy a Rails app is seeing all of their assets being deleted? If so I would think this would be widely reported. Is this a recent regression?
"
5019,Positive,"Thanks. Of course I can/could/will use something else, but I also prefer, if I can, to push for a world where things work well. I'm sure you get just as annoyed as I do by shit we have to deal each and every day that we really shouldn't in 2013.

Regarding spaces breaking shells, absolutely not. POSIX shells, which most shells we encounter on Unix systems are, handle spaces perfectly. Things shouldn't be run through shells at all if possible, but even if they were, argument parsing rules for a POSIX shell are fairly easy. At worst, wrap everything in single quotes and escape a backslash and a single quote and done.
"
5020,Neutral,"To @filipegiusti's [suggestion](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/issues/725#issuecomment-29962869): Is there a way to setup different users for the proxy as for the deployment server(s) themselves? Something like:

```
require 'net/ssh/proxy/command'

set :ssh_options, {
  auth_methods: %w(publickey),
  proxy: Net::SSH::Proxy::Command.new('ssh jump_user@proxy -W %h:%p'),
}

role :app, %w{root@prod_server1 deploy@prod_server2}

"
5027,Neutral,"Hmm. I would prefer not to add a setting.

Instead, what if we internally track a ""key"" for each server which is the string that was used to originally declare it. We always match on this key. (That means we could use a Hash, rather than looping through servers using `matches?`.)

For example:

``` ruby
server ""db01"", :roles => %w(db) # key is ""db01""
server ""app@host"", :roles => %w(app) # key is ""app@host""

# This merges a new property onto db01 since the keys match
server ""db01"", :primary => true

# This creates a new server, since the keys do not match
server ""web@host"", :roles => %w(app)
```

Another example:

``` ruby
# The key in both cases is ""server1"", so the properties are merged
role :redis, %w{server1 server2 server3 server4}, redis: { port: 6379, slave: true}
server 'server1', redis: { slave: false }
```

This might make everyone happy. Thoughts?

5030,Positive,"Josh, you're right that there is a new, similar issue with php 5.6. That
issue is the use of zend opcache, which does not realize a change has been
made when a symlink is updated.

Fortunately, since you're using fpm, all your processes share a cache, so
if you clear it (the one used by fpm, not the cli) after updating the
symlink, it should solve your problem.

5035,Neutral,"> Is what you described the reason I have to insert an exit statement when running `bash` as the command?

> Would you mind submitting a formal pull request for this and closing the issue?

Sure, but I wanted a better solution first, since this solution is quite use case specific.

For instance, `run` can take a block which might want to read from standard input, which is used in Capistrano::Deploy::Strategy::Remote#scm_run.  Since this block is only called when output it received, it wouldn't be able to send data before any output is received without using the `:data` option.  So this solution would actually conflict with this use case.

A better solution would check wether a block is passed to `run`, if this isn't the case it would close the standard input stream.

Closing the standard input stream may be useful even if a block is passed to `run`.  So an explicit option to change the default behaviour would account for this use case, and `run` could `||=` this option based on whether a block is passed to the method.  This would make it easier to implement, a solution because `run` just uses `run_tree`, which wouldn't know whether a block is passed to `run`, so an options would propagate this knowledge.
"
5036,Neutral,"I posted the stackoverflow suggestion. The only thing is that sometimes `deploy:cold` might be run from an automated script like a build server, in which case the process would hang or downright fail every time.

5042,Neutral,"Actually considering this further, I seem to recall that `filter` is actually an alias for `select`, meaning that this is actually the opposite of what you would need here - maybe we need to implement an `except` option, or alternatively just set a default option to all servers of `release: true` and then explicitly set `release: false` for the servers that don't require the code.  That way maybe `on roles :all, select: :release` might read a little better.

We really don't like config flags because they're all in a flat namespace, and we have to be very careful about what options we make the defaults. We'd also need to know how widely `--one-file-system` is supported across multiple implementations of `rm`.

5061,Neutral,"@aspiers @leehambley Alternatively, you can use Chef. Here's a snippet of my recipe.

 app_dir.join(""shared"", ""config""),

    group ""foo""
    mode 0755

5063,Neutral,"Hi James,

I'm not interested in making Capistrano thread safe, it was never designed to be used like that. You might have more success with multi-process, but you'll have to throw Sidekiq and your Actor pattern out.

I'm not even certain if the underlying Net::SSH implementation is thread safe. There is WIP on a replacement release of Capistrano with a significantly different architecture, and more flexibility, I can't give you a timeline but ""summer 2012"" seems like a reasonable ballpark.

As a workaround, I'd recommend looking for the Sidekiq equivalent of Resque::Lock, or perhaps even better - have your actors fork the deploy task.

Just some food for thought, short version - bide your time, the changes required would probably be a disaster (DSL and config, and task execution would need to change, and testing for thread safety is a nightmare, so we'd be looking at a LOT of work), the new implementation has a Queue/Actor pattern at the heart of it's design, so is much more likely to be right by default.

5067,Negative,"Bundle install isn't the only issue.  I have a custom task I was running after deploy:update_code to write my production database.yml files.  If this doesn't go before the asset precompile, I get a failure because rake isn't loading right.  There are other post-code-update things people might want to do as well that may affect how it runs.  I ended up moving it to before deploy:finalize_update, but it feels wrong and brittle to have to jigger things around like that.

Would before deploy:symlink be so bad?  I can't think of anything else that would depend on this update except for the running app, so it seems like a good place to make it happen without being affected by anything else.
"
5068,Negative,"There's still something that is not clear to me. It seems the session is only responsible for job control, right? So, it's not actually a problem if you don't double-fork (or use disown in a bash shell) for getting the goal of running a generic process as a daemon, right? I mean, not a real daemon, but a background process that won't get any other signals from the process group since it was the only remaining process in that group and has been orphaned and will be the single process in the session id created by the original shell. The session leader (the shell) process will be gone, so job control is no longer an issue, right?

So, why do you say that your background implementation may still not work for some cases?

    proxy: Net::SSH::Proxy::Command.new('ssh mygateway.com -W %h:%p'),

I guess in a similar manner you can have that globally. Having this solution I don't think we need to add support directly into capistrano, but it would be good to document it somewhere.
"
5071,Neutral,"Anyway, the Capistrano is not loading the $LANG var from my server

Capistrano runs a non-interactive terminal, where things like $LANG are of
no consequence, you should specify to use a PTY if you need environmental
variables.

But I won't patch thing iside of Capistrano, this is a problem of either a)
bundler, or b) ruby.

5088,Negative,"@kot-behemoth The decision was taken to remove run_locally as the following case was really confusing:

``` ruby
run_locally do
  within(""some_directory"") do
    rake ""pwd""
  end
end
```

In this case the `within` and `rake` are unaffected by the `run_locally`, and execute on the server as normal. That is to say the `run_locally` and `on` APIs weren't (and couldn't be made to be) symmetrical.

As a result is was removed, it'd be better to use the rake provided [`sh`](http://rake.rubyforge.org/classes/FileUtils.html#M000018), or something like [`Open3`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/open3/rdoc/Open3.html) and the logging methods from Capistrano/SSHKit.

There are some traces in the code for SSHKit still of `run_locally`, but they will go away when we do some spring cleaning. Unfortunately it was a bit of a failed experiment, and we never felt entirely comfortable with `run_locally` being a part of a _remote_ orchestration tool (either Capistrano, or by extension SSHKit.)

A couple of suggestions:

'1. Can croutonversion be put outside the chroot in /usr/local/bin ? I realize it can be accessed with a much longer path outside of the chroot, but a link or just putting it in usr/local/bin from crosh/shell would save me time, from remembering it is in: 

/usr/local/chroots/precise/usr/local/bin/croutonversion or an even longer 

/mnt/stateful_partition/ ...

What I currently do is sudo enter-chroot or sudo startxfce4, and from there /usr/local/bin/croutonversion -d -u replaces my old crouton with the new crouton (backing up the old one to crouton.old or something might be a nice idea too, just in case ...)

then exit the chroot and run the update command.

[update: Below may not be an issue, I am playing audio started in Chromium OS, and it is playing fine after I toggled to the chroot, worked in the chroot, and exited, or toggled back - audio app is just chrome browser playing an mp3]

'2. I may be the exception here, but is it possible to get updates without the CRAS components? I actually like being able to start and play audio in Chrome, and have that audio playing seamlessly as I work in the chroot or go go back and forth.

5102,Positive,"Hi,

I forked the project to update the boot scripts so it installs an extended set of packages (texlive-full, nginx, etc). I added these to `installer/ubuntu/bootstrap`, however, I found that these lines were never executed.

I then proceeded to add echo statements which also never showed up. It seemed that despite changing the URLs in `installer/crouton`, the files being procured were older versions.

Looking at `/tmp/crouton-installer-cache`, I noticed that this script is being generated from `build/wrapper.sh` and that there is a specific git revision that it is using. My guess is that this is the revision from which the remaining files are checked out.

I tracked this down to `build/release.sh` which is supposed to create the releases. Unfortunately, I'm not quite sure how to use this script works. It expects me to provide it a bundle (`git bundle`? Which I tried BTW) which I'm not sure how to create/generate. Some help on how to use this would be greatly appreciated.

5104,Negative,"xiwi appears to pass through post-Chromium-keyboard-layout keypresses, which then confuses X11.  That is, if you use a keyboard layout that maps s -> r and r -> p, pressing the S key in xiwi will result in an R keypress in X11.  If you are then silly enough to set up the same keyboard layout inside of X11, that R will then be helpfully translated into a P by X11.

xiwi should send raw keypresses, disregarding any keyboard layout settings.

In a nutshell, My ASUS Chromebook will boot into XFCE4 fine and dandy, however loading the ""Dustforce"" game from steam will cause the game to boot up fine, then crash the entire system after about 20 seconds. While the game is playing there is a smooth framerate, but the audio will cut out and the display will switch off entirely. I know that the computer is still running, because I can switch back into ChromeOS and lock the computer, then unlock it using Smart Lock and my phone vibrates and tells me the Chromebook has been unlocked.

What would help me is if there were logs of the command line kept somewhere while I am in the XFCE enviroment, as I'm not able to look at them while the computers screen is off. Does anyone know where they might be kept?

5119,Negative,"Some time ago when the Pixel 2015 was released an issue was logged noting numerous performance issues in 14.04 including but not limited to graphical glitches on the mouse cursor when swapping between Chrome OS and Ubuntu, and a variety of other problems. I personally experienced poor performance, constant crashes in XFCE, games with sound errors and poor performance not present in 13.04 and 14.04 on 2995U-powered Chromebooks, hanging and crashing when logged out/rebooting/powering off via Ubuntu, and more.

In that issue (see link below) a solution was posted referencing the updating of the Intel graphics drivers. The good news is that for the Intel HD5500 and up (Broadwell i3, i5 and i7) this solves the issues. In fact on my Pixel after using this, Unity 14.04 is ridiculously great and everything I've tried has worked incredibly well.

Sadly, it looks like this driver update does NOT update the 3205U ""Intel HD Graphics"" for the Broadwell Celeron. These systems are still not working well at all in Crouton. 

Those of us who are mere mortals over on Reddit have not been able to figure out a solution to this and I found it odd that it didn't seem to be covered here, thus I figured I'd post it in the event that a) this wasn't a known problem, or b) it was a known problem with a solution (fingers crossed).

5120,Positive,"Hey,

Sorry to be vague in my question title, basicly I need some clarification.
I understand that when using Xephyr (Which is what we use on ARM chromebooks); there can be no acceleration.

Say I get the lib's (libgl etc ...) bundled with the driver.
My questions are as follows : 
- If it were possible to run a second X Session, would that session be 3d accelerated ?
- If that is not possible, would it be possible to use a console (tty) to kill the main X server, then chroot and launch a replacement ?
- Could that have 3d acceleration ?

I really appreciate the efforts of the developers who put this together, currently my XFCE chroot is brilliant, but deep down I yearn for Gnome Shell ;)

#### Please describe your issue:
I've tried creating several Jessie, Stretch, Sid, and Kali-Rolling chroots since getting my Acer R11 over Christmas. In maybe half of the instances, once the install is finished, I have been able to successfully boot into xfce. The other half of the time, Xorg will hang on startup, and will give the appearance of my machine locking up. Using the shortcut to switch between ChromeOS and the chroot will allow me to regain control, though Xorg will then fail and exit.

In the instances where I've been able to at least enter the chroots when starting them up for the first time, after two or three starts, Xorg will hang in the same way it does for the chroots that I was never to enter xfce in in the first place.

Strangely enough, I've had zero issues of this sort when using Xenial. I haven't tried other Ubuntu releases, though.

Apologies if I'm not describing this well. If I can clarify anything or provide logs, let me know. I have found bug reports involving black screens, but nothing that seems to match this exactly. I did try the uxa fix in #2923 in my latest Kali-rolling chroot, but to no avail. 

#### If known, describe the steps to reproduce the issue:
1) Create Jessie, Stretch, Sid, or Kali-rolling chroots with xfce, keyboard, and extension targets.
2) Attempt to enter xfce, either with sudo enter-chroot, followed by startxfce4 inside the chroot, or sudo startxfce4 from crosh.
3) If able to enter the DE, wait awhile and try starting xfce later."

5126,Neutral,"I am trying to install a LAMP stack on my Toshiba Chromebook 2 (CB35-B3340) but am having trouble installing mysql. My machine has been running Ubuntu 14.04 and Unity for about 6 months (and did Ruby on Rails dev without major issues) and I created a new chroot with Ubuntu 12.04 and XFCE after running into a lot of issues with mysql on my other install.

Every time I run mysql on either chroot, it gives me the following error: 

```
ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)
```

I have checked the my.cnf file and created a folder at the location it expects for mysqld.sock to appear. I have mysql-server installed. I tried running commands like /etc/init.d/mysql start, and also tried various commands to get mysqld to start. The mysqld file was very difficult to find in the 14.04 system, and entire folders of the install seemed to be missing. 

How should I deal with this? I just want to do local wordpress theme development.

5132,Neutral,"Once #234 merges, `crouton -u -n $chroot` should be very safe; it will update all targets, maintaining the release and mirror setting.  This means we could conceivably update crouton in an automated fashion.

A few questions I'd like to open up:
1. Is this a good idea?  Chromium OS does auto-updates very well, but it was designed from the ground-up to support it.  Updates downloaded but only applied atomically upon reboot.  The Linux userspace, on the other hand was never really designed for auto-updates.  Things aren't updated atomically, although open file semantics tend to keep running software working fine.  crouton itself should be fine with auto-updates, as flag semantics don't change.  People may not like the idea of their Linux install auto-updating, others may never update crouton or their chroot unless we do so for them.  Some sort of auto-updating may be necessary for the cras (#343) target, as updates to Chromium OS do not guarantee protocol compatibility for cras.  Perhaps auto-updates could be optionally disabled via a file in /etc/crouton
2. Should auto-updates happen in the background?  If we do it in the background, updates to things like xephyr and touch will not apply until the next time crouton is started.  cras (#343) updates should apply for all newly-opened audio applications.  This isn't that far off of Chromium OS's behavior (requiring reboot), and we may be able to use zenity or the like to make a ""restart crouton"" icon once the update is complete.  Doing updates in the foreground would introduce an annoying delay when launching crouton, but you'd immediately get the updates.
3. When should auto-update be triggered?  Checking each time enter-chroot is called is excessive.  We could limit it to once a week, or only auto-update when we detect that Chromium OS has auto-updated (via differences in /etc/lsb-release), which would have the benefit of updating more frequently for dev users.  Updates require a sizable chunk of data (crouton is small, but it triggers an upgrade of the underlying package manager as well), so should it avoid updating over mobile connections?
4. Feedback.  How to provide feedback to the user that crouton is checking for updates, updating, and done updating?  zenity systray icons for desktop environments works, but what about for cli-only users?
"
5133,Neutral,"If you use the -e flag when setting up crouton, when it prompts you to set up the root password, if you fail to give the same password twice or Ctrl-C out of the process before it succeeds, it never asks again.  Restarting ""crouton -e"" doesn't ask you for this again, even though it didn't succeed in setting it the last time it tried.

I tried running ""passwd"" and ""sudo passwd"" to try and set up a password manually, but I keep getting errors about the password DB being locked.  Obviously the crouton scripts are doing something else, but it's not clear to me what.
"
5134,Neutral,"I was trying to write an image to an SD card for my Raspberry Pi when I came across what looks to be a bug which results in a crash and subsequent reboot.

Machine : ARM Chromebook
Target : cli-extra

I confirmed the issue by running through the same command:

`sudo dd bs=4M if=~/Downloads/rasbian.img of=/dev/mmcblk1`

It works for a while but then crashes before finishing. This results in a partially written image.

Not really sure how to debug this or any logs that might need to be included...
"
5135,Neutral,"**Commands with `ralt` have no effect**

My current set up is to start my chroot with `sudo enter-chroot xinit`, reading from the following `.xinitrc` file:

```
setxkbmap -rules evdev -model evdev -layout us -variant intl
exec i3
```

As you can see I've set it up to use the US international keyboard layout. Under ChromeOS having this layout works the following way: If I want the letter `ü` I type `Shift + '` followed by `u`. By replacing u with a or o I get ä or ö. Yet the letter ß works differently, I have to type `ralt + s`. So far so good.

Before using xiwi I remember it working just the same way under my chroot. Yet now, probably due to it being windowed, the behaviour has changed: in order to get ä, ö or ü I have to press `Shift + '` twice in order for it to work, which isn't too much of an inconvenience. But trying to get the letter ß has proven to be impossible. When I try the default command all I get is `s`. 

Any ideas?
"
5136,Neutral,"Running crouton with **-t xephyr,xfce,keyboard -r saucy**, on Pixel.

dpi was adjusted to 239 via editing xserverrc, as explained on the Chromebook Pixel page.

The pointer arrow is presented as two distinct pieces, right next to each other. On the desktop it is as though a normal arrow were cut in two, and the two pieces displayed next to each other. In a terminal it looks like two misshapen square brackets.

This happens only in a xephyr chroot.

I tried to take a screenshot with Xfce's Screenshot tool, but the image came out with the arrow looking normal!

5137,Neutral,"My primary use case for crouton is the terminal environment. Sometimes, I'd like to take advantage of `croutonurlhandler` to open links from Mutt (by setting `export BROWSER=""croutonurlhandler -n""` in my `.zshrc`. To do this, `croutonwebsocket` needs to run as a background process.

If I put `croutonwebsocket &` in `/etc/rc.local`, it is (obviously) run as root -- consequently, only `sudo croutonurlhandler` works as expected. Without it, the following error happens:

```
$ croutonurlhandler http://www.google.com/
/usr/local/bin/croutonurlhandler: 207: /usr/local/bin/croutonurlhandler: cannot create /tmp/crouton-ext/lock: Permission denied
Error timeout
```

If I run `croutonwebsocket &` in terminal as current user, it does not have an available pipe: `checkfifo: /tmp/crouton-ext/in exists, but not readable and writable.`

Is there an expected setup that I'm missing here? Should I be running `croutonwebsocket` with `upstart`?

#### To reproduce

install chroot with `-t unity,kde,xorg,xiwi,audio,touch,extension` added to the installer script
possibly install KDE5
update from precise to xenial
update all packages
set default xserver as xorg
then start unity with `sudo startunity`

I updated the crouton installer and everything but no... My machine is Acer C720. Did I do something or is this some bug?

5144,Positive,"Thanks for all of your hard work on Crouton!  I still can't believe how well this all works together, giving me a lighweight and inexpensive, yet fully functional laptop with fantastic battery life!

I decided I wanted to do something with Audacity this morning, so I went through the typical ""apt-get install audacity"".  But when I tried to start audacity, my Chromebook rebooted.  When I try to launch it from a terminal window, I can see something about a jack server just before the reboot.  I'm not terribly familiar with the state of audio on Linux, but I have a feeling the chroot and Chrome OS are probably fighting over the sound device.  Issue #111 sounded similar.

Any ideas what could be going on?  My crouton chroot is raring running xfce4.

Thanks!
"
5145,Neutral,"Try adding users using `adduser` or `useradd`:

Run `sudo enter-chroot` to enter a shell then type `sudo adduser [USER]`, replacing [USER] with the name of the user you want to add. After answering the prompts, type `exit`.

You can now start unity for the new user with `sudo startunity -u  [USER]`."
5146,Neutral,"It looks like ARM may get 3.8 soon, I see kernel 3.8.11 being built in the Chromium OS builders:

So it looks like it's just a matter of time until 3.8 appears on the dev channel (if it's not already there).

5147,Negative,"Feel your pain, very annoying with xiwi emacs.

I have found the repeating space to kick in with two or more input methods on the chromeos side. Still, ctrl+shift+space or ctrl+@ will work and give null char, debug with `xev`.

As a workaround for xiwi I kind of add a shift with xbindkeys.
Add `(xbindkey '(control space) ""xset r off; xte 'keyup space'; xte 'keydown Shift_L' 'key space' 'keyup Shift_L'; xset r on"" )` to [~/.xbindkeysrc.scm](https://github.com/nxtr/dotfiles/blob/ae6dc4fee6ced6a6e55d932c80131ffe41456b26/.xbindkeysrc.scm#L66-L67)

The repeats over and over again hundreds of times. I may have discovered this is a Chrome OS problem. 

https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=424271

Seems like the coders at Google are aware that CRAS is eating more CPU then it should. They say Os version 40 will resolve this but they may not fix it for 39..... I'll keep you posted.

5153,Neutral,"hi @divx118, et al.,

the [common issues and reporting doc](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/wiki/Common-issues-and-reporting) here did not work for me - did all it said that i could, still get the same error loading drivers at start up and it exits out of crouton, never gets even to a terminal where i could play around with stuff. really wish someone could tell me where the GLX and video intel hd controller config. files for X11, or the reference configs for xbmc, are located so i could maybe edit them and get out of this problem. i tried doing `find` and `grep` to search for *.conf files or driver phrases in files, and can't find _any_, or find so many references to something like ""GLX"" that its unusable and i don't know where to narrow the search. i looked in `/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d` directory and there were only input drivers there: keyboard, mouse & trackpad, no video driver *.conf files. again, i have also posted this here as a separate issue, #1118.

Sounds like that's the problem. 
Make sure `/etc/init/crouton.conf` has the saved changes I listed above with the correct path to your external media.

5155,Neutral,"@air: Is there a way to get LXC to run without another instance of `/dev/pts`?

I understand this is desired for additional separation between the host and the container, but it is possible to start containers without it.
"
5156,Neutral,"I notice the line 

> xfce4-settings-helper: Another instance is already running. Leaving...

This makes me wonder if perhaps you should turn off and restart your machine. This might also be a good time to try the often-easy-solution of updating with

> sudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -u -n chrootname

and pay careful attention to whether or not you get any errors. 

Supposing that doesn't do anything. What happens if you do ctrl+alt+shift forward/back?

Further, can you do ctrl+alt forward followed by ctrl+alt+refresh and see if that behaves differently? I've had incomplete installs/updates in the past where I used this temporary workaround before resolving my problems.
"
5157,Positive,"Hi guys - I'm happy to help here with testing and dev if you could point me into the right direction. 

@dnschneid I can see that X on Mali on Samsung Chromebook 3 has some form of acceleration but then you've mentioned Mali drivers don't support multiple X servers.  Is it possible to use the same trick with Tegra or is it purely up to the drivers?

@alextnewman It looks like the Tegra graphics drivers for TK1 have more functionality built in when browsing through the source code.  Have you tried to compile new chromium kernel? Issue #979 lists relevant kernel source code.

5158,Neutral,"Keep in mind that on the ARM chromebook, you won't have any video acceleration when playing in crouton (since it isn't directly accessing the video hardware).  That means you lose the hardware decode, and you'll get graphical tearing when it plays back.

That having been said, you should be able to get audio over HDMI.  It may be a matter of just changing the default alsa device, or installing and using PulseAudio.

5160,Neutral,"Hello, as weird as it may seem, Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F2/Right-Arrow is not working.
This is a Toshiba Chromebook 2, maybe that's related to that. I tried both with the original key settings, and the modified ones that I normally use (swapping Search and Ctrl_L). I find it curious that even with the ChromeOS layout changed, I still have to press the Ctrl key, instead of the Search key.

In my case, I have to move from ChromeOS to teminal (pressing Ctrl+Alt+F2/Right Arrow) and from there, Ctrl+Alt+F3/Refresh if I want to go to Crouton, at least this is what I've been doing.

I have just tried Ctrl+Alt+Left-Arrow in ChromeOS, and it doesn't work here. It DOES work from Crouton back to ChromeOS, by pressing Ctrl_R, and Alt_R.

Any ideas?

5170,Neutral,"@ibukanov you need to add xiwi as the first target at this time per open issues #1198 and #1274 (duplicate/closed)

so did you add xiwi first like:

sudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -t xiwi,unity -u -r trusty

the `extension` target is not needed on the above line as xiwi pulls it in, but the Chrome Store App Crouton Extension v2 does need to be retrieved and installed.

I have to say I got everything set up -- thanks to you -- and I'm really starting to get the hang of linux. All of those programs you recommended are great. And I even found some more from the ubuntu software center.

Except now I came across this unexpected problem. When I launch through crouton integration, it gives me this error: 

![screenshot 2015-06-27 at 12 22 21 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11172428/8392934/1eb109ec-1cc8-11e5-89d2-f968d522649f.png)

The first time getting this, I was able to still get in after some time, and a little luck, but now I'm out of luck.

I think I understand the problem. With crouton integration I have a general issue with screen resolution. For example, my firefox browser is huge and not enjoyable to use. I've messed around with the screen resolution settings a bunch and even after selecting the smallest setting everything is larger than life. I tried a few times to launch gnome the normal way [In other words - not through a window on chrome os], and it just won't launch. Maybe I can fix this issue if I can get back into it that way?

from a crosh shell terminal without bringing up a graphical desktop of your chroot?
"
5189,Negative,"Oh,sorry.
"
5190,Neutral,"@trusktr,

Maybe.
Perhaps running `dpkg-reconfigure locales` on more releases or even on all of them wouldn't harm anything and may just help to avoid this issue.

The devs can take a look at this maybe when they get a free cycle or two.

-**DennisL**"
5191,Neutral,"1. Put it at the end of that command.
2. Yes, the chroot will shut down as well.  You should probably get that fixed.
3. Yes, but it does not actively write over it on the physical media, so theoretically you could recover the data via a forensic command like `foremost` (unless Chromium OS uses TRIM, which might make it more difficult).  If you're worried about sensitive deleted data being recoverable, encrypt your chroot using `-e`.
"
5192,Neutral,"I am having the same issue.  Not sure what hardware the OP is using, but I'm on an Asus Flip running ChromeOS dev v53.
"
5193,Positive,"Yes, the CRAS updates are fine, at least for what I do, which is launch audio in Chromium OS, and it plays fine when in the chroot or even toggling back and forth.
"
5194,Neutral,"@Herran have you recently rebooted?  If you previously unmounted selinux or something, you'll get errors until you reboot.

5196,Neutral,"Try to follow #1715 as well because that is a similar problem and if that gets solved, then maybe you could get the chroot.
"
5197,Neutral,"@DennisLfromGA Can you clarify about how you get crosh / shell terminal windows? The only way I know of is the ctrl alt T way, and I often have several up simultaneously, but the one I""m referring to would be the crosh / shell window that I started the chroot up in, and receives debug info. in. I'm not sure I remember any other ways to get a terminal other than ctrl alt T ?
"
5198,Neutral,"@DennisLfromGA  

I am comfortable trying to edit the script. However what I am unsure about is it a physical file that I am editing on my chromebook? Would that be the crouton file I downloaded and what program do I use to open that up and edit it. or do I edit a command when I type it into shell?
"
5199,Neutral,"Update and answer to myself: No, `/proc/sys/kernel/chromiumos/module_locking` does not even exist with a verified RO rootfs, So, unfortunately, making the rootfs r/w-able seems to be the only way to get this hack done.
"
5200,Neutral,"I have this problem sometimes too. Not sure what causes it, but I just keep retrying until it works.
"
5201,Neutral,Another way to do the same thing without having to go into the alternate terminal (where copy and paste doesn't work) is to just run `ssh root@localhost` use the root password you set and then run `chromeos-setdevpasswd` to set the sudo password.
5202,Neutral,"@tedm,

> Is there a list showing which user selected targets will bring in which dependencies?

Yes, when you run crouton with the '-t list' option, it shows the targets/DEs and their prerequisites (Requires:).
"
5203,Positive,"I appreciate the help.  Thanks.  But as a non-technical person who's trying very hard to follow along and teach myself ... what exactly do I type into the developer shell?  And do I need to have a USB drive to receive the tarball file?  Or I just need to re-download it onto each Chromebook and restore from there ... which I'm not sure how to type that in either. =)
"
5204,Neutral,"Yeah, it looks like you removed way more than just xscreensaver.

5205,Negative,"I can't understand the result since a native mode which has 1920x1080 is named `kiwi_1920x1080_60`, and the others are 4:3 aspects mixed... :(

xrandr --output default --scale 1x1 --mode kiwi_1920x1080_60

"
5206,Neutral,"Not really; that's actually quite a lot of margin.  Unlike other OSes, Chromium OS updates don't necessarily increase the size of the image.
"
5207,Neutral,"@dnschneid, you can close this issue.

For anyone else with this problem, it's been fixed in the latest versions of crouton. Simply re-download the installer and run `sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -u -t CHROOTNAME`. All your files will be kept.
"
5208,Positive,"Great! I get lucky every now and then...
"
5209,Negative,"I rebooted and it is there now. Odd. mount from crosh/shell after reboot, and before entering startxfce4 chroot is below. Not sure if this is relevant, but thunar in the GUI pane for /home/ted/ shows /home/ted/Download (note: no 's'), but in shell, chromeos contents are [post reboot] now in /home/ted/Downloads (correct, with 's').

btw, there is no sd card in the slot, let me know if you want that written up separately, but the chroots seem to keep a memory of them. Let me know if you want a new issue opened for that.

Are there any plans to update the crouton installer to work with _precise_ and Chrome 53, or is this a lost cause?
"
5215,Neutral,"Yes, without make_dev_ssd. Insmodding modules just works as said above. No need to change chromeos rootfs to rw.

Edit: Hmm I looked at the code and am now wondering if the sysfs path should even exist. They have some code in there to create the above mentioned /proc/sys/kernel/chromiumos/module_locking when rootfs is not readonly. However line 224 exposes the parameter to /sys. Not that I am complaining I like having the ability to load my own modules on the readonly system I also don't see any harm in that. Or am I incorrect?

######################################################################## 100.0%
No arg for -n option
crouton [options] -t targets
crouton [options] -f backup_tarball
crouton [options] -d -f bootstrap_tarball

Constructs a chroot for running a more standard userspace alongside Chromium OS.

If run with -f, where the tarball is a backup previously made using edit-chroot,
the chroot is restored and relevant scripts installed.

If run with -d, a bootstrap tarball is created to speed up chroot creation in
the future. You can use bootstrap tarballs generated this way by passing them
to -f the next time you create a chroot with the same architecture and release.

crouton must be run as root unless -d is specified AND fakeroot is
installed AND /tmp is mounted exec and dev.

It is highly recommended to run this from a crosh shell (Ctrl+Alt+T), not VT2.

Options:
    -a ARCH     The architecture to prepare a new chroot or bootstrap for.
                Default: autodetected for the current chroot or system.
    -b          Restore crouton scripts in PREFIX/bin, as required by the
                chroots currently installed in PREFIX/chroots.
    -d          Downloads the bootstrap tarball but does not prepare the chroot.
    -e          Encrypt the chroot with ecryptfs using a passphrase.
                If specified twice, prompt to change the encryption passphrase.
    -f TARBALL  The bootstrap or backup tarball to use, or to download to (-d).
                When using an existing tarball, -a and -r are ignored.
    -k KEYFILE  File or directory to store the (encrypted) encryption keys in.
                If unspecified, the keys will be stored in the chroot if doing a
                first encryption, or auto-detected on existing chroots.
    -m MIRROR   Mirror to use for bootstrapping and package installation.
                Default depends on the release chosen.
                Can only be specified during chroot creation and forced updates
                (-u -u). After installation, the mirror can be modified using
                the distribution's recommended way.
    -M MIRROR2  A secondary mirror, often used for security updates.
                Can only be specified alongside -m.
    -n NAME     Name of the chroot. Default is the release name.
                Cannot contain any slash (/).
    -p PREFIX   The root directory in which to install the bin and chroot
                subdirectories and data.
                Default: /usr/local, with /usr/local/chroots linked to
                /mnt/stateful_partition/crouton/chroots.
    -P PROXY    Set an HTTP proxy for the chroot; effectively sets http_proxy.
                Specify an empty string to remove a proxy when updating.
    -r RELEASE  Name of the distribution release. Default: precise,
                or auto-detected if upgrading a chroot and -n is specified.
                Specify 'help' or 'list' to print out recognized releases.
    -t TARGETS  Comma-separated list of environment targets to install.
                Specify 'help' or 'list' to print out potential targets.
    -T TARGETFILE  Path to a custom target definition file that gets applied to
                the chroot as if it were a target in the crouton bundle.
    -u          If the chroot exists, runs the preparation step again.
                You can use this to install new targets or update old ones.
                Passing this parameter twice will force an update even if the
                specified release does not match the one already installed.
    -V          Prints the version of the installer to stdout.

Be aware that dev mode is inherently insecure, even if you have a strong
password in your chroot! Anyone can simply switch VTs and gain root access
unless you've permanently assigned a Chromium OS root password. Encrypted
chroots require you to set a Chromium OS root password, but are still only as
secure as the passphrases you assign to them.

5231,Neutral,"I had tried using xiwi with the extension, no luck
what fixed the issue for me was found here

https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/1265

specifically i used the command

sudo CROUTON_BRANCH=x11_freon sh ~/Downloads/crouton -t xfce -n trusty -u

this switched the branch and updated my chroot and works with chrome os Version 41.0.2272.89 (64-bit)

That is the current fix for the issue I was having.

It's also gets really annoying and irritating cause I'm trying to log out, (you know, get out of linux). Should I just try the crouton integration thingy? (not a big fan of crouton in  tab).
"
5233,Positive,"hi @Watney, @smibarber & @divx118 —

@Watney's command line suggestion is what did it for me, though i needed to make an adjustment, it should actually be:

`sudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -p /media/removable/USB\ Drive -n trusty -u`

it does not need `.../chroots/` to show where the chroot directory is, because it adds that on to the script itself, it just needs the path to the directory one level above that.

@smibarber — i am the only one on my Chromebook, no other profiles.

thanks for the help, all. it's o.k. to close this one out, i got my ubuntu linux install on my USB stick recovered and working again. thank you very much!

5234,Neutral,"It is the systemd matter. Systemd requires its PID to be 1 but we cannot do that for a chroot as we have Chrome OS already started with its init process occupying PID1.

The foreseeable support is when Chrome OS update all stable version kernels to 3.8. Only unstable channel of some hardware is on 3.8 right now. 3.8 provides PID Namespace and we can create a separate PID namespace which everything starts with PID 1 for the chroot. Then systemd would work.

However, if that's happening , we probably don't even need chroot anymore.

If you are interested in PID namespace, see the pull request: https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=135526066121436&w=2

5244,Neutral,"@marcino239 There is quite a bit of functionality built into the driver stack on the chromebook, but it appears to be a reduced feature set (embedded maybe?) from the Jetson TK1 (there is no OpenGL 4.4 renderer as far as I can tell; only OpenGL 2.1 and GLES 3.x). I checked out the chromium sources using the release tag I was currently running but the kernel I built did not boot (I suspect my minimalistic boot configuration was missing _vital magic_. 

However, I was able to jam the ChromeOS X drivers into a Wheezy rootfs. I also ported Doom 3 to it for illustrative purposes:

5254,Positive,"XBMC will be tricky to get working with hardware acceleration on the Samsung ARM, but it should be doable as some people as using it on the Raspberry Pi...

I just tried to start it on `precise`, and it fails on startup (it says it needs OpenGL hardware acceleration), how did you even get it to start?

As far as I can tell, XBMC packaged with Ubuntu (and Arch) only comes with OpenGL support (`--enable-gl`), but the Samsung ARM does not have OpenGL support, only OpenGL ES. So you'd need to recompile it with `--enable-gles` (which apparently can take a very long time and a lot of memory).

You could try some prebuilt packages (maybe this one: http://michael.gorven.za.net/raspberrypi/xbmc, but it's a bit outdated now). Then copy over the OpenGL ES libraries from Chrome OS to the chroot (`/usr/lib/libEGL*.so*` and `/usr/lib/libGLES*.so*`, and maybe something in `/usr/lib/xorg/modules/`, I can help with more detailled instructions if you want to try this).

```

But I don't use Xiwi, so it might be different from X11/freon in various options.

In general, Modern Desktop Environments like Gnome, Unity, Kdesktop, and so, we won't suggest such X11 server-side-scaling for the purpose of ""font-scaling"". since these DEs have client-side ""font-scaling"" and ""HiDPI-scaling"" techniques already. So you should use them to get better readability on High resolution displays.

@clodben: it sounds like your Chromium OS root password isn't what you think it is; had your friend set one earlier?  Can you run `sudo -i` from crosh?  If you cannot, and your friend doesn't know what the password might be, then I'm afraid there's no way to get root on the system to run chroot stuff.  You'll need to wipe the machine to get root access again (either powerwash from advanced settings, or switch into verified mode and back).

5281,Neutral,"Ok. So you did set a password in Chrome OS. crouton only asks you to set one _if_ you enable encryption (`-e` at install time).

Pressing Ctrl-C when asked to set the password, or setting it to an empty string, will prevent you from login as root again (the Ctrl-C bug was fixed in Chromium OS build >=5875 (current beta/dev channel)).

I'm sorry but the only way to recover from that is a powerwash. You will not be able to backup your chroot using `edit-chroot`, however you should be able to recover files in your chroot home directory (`/usr/local/chroots/yourchrootname/home/yourusername`).

5291,Positive,"@artemkolotilkin, thanks for offering to help.  As far as I can tell, the main remaining, perplexing issue is that gconf seems to be behaving differently when indirectly launched via a DM (be it lightdm or gdm) than it does when launched via xinit, which transitively makes gnome-session behave strangely.  gconf is not properly pulling in the systemwide default values for items.  Here's what I think the next things to try would be:
1. Grab the crouton-desktops build from #61.  Be aware that the crouton used in there is quite old, so when you use it, specify a different prefix (i.e. `-p /usr/local/desktops` or something).
2. Install the ubuntu target to a chroot: `sudo sh -e crouton-desktop -p /usr/local/desktops -t ubuntu`.
3. Use `sudo sh -e /usr/local/desktops/startdm` to start lightdm, and log into a unity session.
4. Use ps and /proc/pid/environ and whatnot to check the gnome-session and gconfd (is that right?) processes, in particular launch command line and environment variables.
5. Do the exact same thing but using the latest crouton creating a unity chroot and launching with startunity.  There won't be a gnome-session process, but there will be a gconfd process (I think).
6. Report back on differences and we can see what to try from there.

When i woke uo my computer was as it was before i did everything. So i did the key pad entry CTRL+ALT+FRWD and it sent me to a black screen. I remember it was CTRL+ALT+REFRESH instead. So that is what i did. Now it is asking me for my local host login. i put in what i thought it was pressed enter and it is now asking for my password. i typed in a possible password but it keeps saying login incorrect. i tried all possible passwords but it is not working. WHAT NOW??????

If you're referring to updating the chroot on external media, then, yes, it needs a path.
You can do that with crouton's '-p' option:

`-p PREFIX   The root directory in which to install the bin and chroot
                subdirectories and data.
                Default: /usr/local, with /usr/local/chroots linked to
                /mnt/stateful_partition/crouton/chroots.`

Something like:

`sudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -p /path/to/external/media -t xorg -n trusty -u`

---

If you're talking about launching a target/DE, I believe if you don't specify the chrootname, it will launch the alphabetically first chroot it finds with the specified target. You can also use the '-c' option to help find it:

`-c CHROOTS  Directory the chroots are in. Default: /mnt/stateful_partition/crouton/chroots`

So for unity, for example, you would use:

`sudo startunity -c /path/to/external/media/chroots`

Another way to start unity, for example, is to give it the full path:

`sudo /path/to/external/media/bin/startunity`

Then it will find the chroot automagically.

---

BTW, the 'x11_freon' branch mentioned above is already merged so you're good to go.

"
5299,Neutral,"Understood. We have a fallback mechanism for this case (I have no idea why @tedm and myself are not having that problem), but the fallback is currently broken.

#742 will fix the problem once it's merged.

Maybe not quite the *exact* same code, you're missing the '**sudo**' prefix -

**`sudo`**`sh ~/Downloads/crouton -t kde`

*Hope this helps,*

5306,Neutral,"More folks reported the same issue here:
https://plus.sandbox.google.com/communities/109120069102230291151/stream/ce07a950-06cb-457e-bf34-de090784cba5

Some reported that running another crouton update has fixed their issues.
So I ran the crouton update again:
sudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -u -n jessie
but I am still having the same issue. Switching into xfce4+jessie I don't get a desktop and also makes ChromeOS unresponsive when switching back.

Somehow I got out of the hanging X session without rebooting and was able to extract my latest Xorg logs:

5308,Neutral,"Have you updated crouton and your chroot recently?
"
5309,Neutral,"so is it not possible to upgrade a chroot without it breaking?
"
5310,Neutral,"sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -r kali -t xfce
"
5311,Positive,"Awesome!

I've tried to gather some info...

Looks like the udev rule for vmmouse change invokes /bin/vmmouse_detect.

http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-branches/ubuntu/wily/xserver-xorg-input-vmmouse/wily/view/head:/tools/69-xorg-vmmouse.rules.in

http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-branches/ubuntu/wily/xserver-xorg-input-vmmouse/wily/view/head:/tools/hal-probe-vmmouse.in

So I tried invoking /bin/vmmouse_detect inside a debian stretch chroot. -- and it did not lock up the console (it had no readily apparent effect at all).

So maybe it's one of the other rules that is causing the lockup.
I dumped all the udev rules on my pixel, and it looks like there are 22 rules for 'input' subsystem.
I'll can continue trying some of these to see whether there's a specific rule that causes the lockup.

The link below is the output of 'udevadm info -e' on a chromebook pixel, filtered for only those entries with SUBSYSTEM=input'.  I think this is 22 separate rules.

[udevadm-info-output-for-input-subsystem.txt](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/files/230940/udevadm-info-output-for-input-subsystem.txt)
"
5312,Positive,"Yep! Make sure the SD card is formatted with some form of ext, then use the `-p` (prefix) parameter to point crouton to the SD card (usually /media/removable/$label); it will install the chroots to $prefix/chroots and the launch scripts to $prefix/bin.  You can then enter chroot either by explicitly using the $prefix/bin scripts, or use the `-c` parameter to explicitly specify the $prefix/chroots directory when using scripts installed to /usr/local/bin.
"
5313,Positive,"Close but no cigar. After creating the delta.conf file it complains about GLIBC_2.17 -

```
sudo lxc-start -n delta-saucy-x64 -f ~/delta-saucy-x64.conf -d
lxc-start: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.17' not found (required by /usr/local/lib/liblxc.so.0)

sudo lxc-attach -n delta-saucy-x64 /bin/bash
lxc-attach: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.17' not found (required by /usr/local/lib/liblxc.so.0)
```

I checked and I do have the files mentioned -

```
ll /usr/local/lib/libxc*
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   11 Feb 18 18:21 liblxc.so -> liblxc.so.0*
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   15 Feb 18 18:21 liblxc.so.0 -> liblxc.so.0.9.0*
```

But I guess GLIBC_2.17 isn't a part of this 3.4.0 OS. Here's what I'm using -

```

```

The 'croutonversion' output of my saucy chroot is -

```

This is no biggy for me, I'll place this on hold for now and wait 'til it's a little more ready-for-prime-time or at least testing.

Thanx all,

"
5314,Positive,"@emanuensis,

This issue might be related to #2047...
So when you quit, you did ""logout"" the desktop environment properly?

Regards.
"
5315,Neutral,"I think /media is the default mount for /dev/[removable devices] and like power management and networking, the host OS can tell if something is plugged in or removed, but since the chroot can as well, or even shut down, the host thinks it may not be in a safe state to eject.

Can unmounting the chroot force an eject of /media devices? Also, how will usb and sdcards work with multiple chrome users logged in at the same time, with first desktop user also having a chroot? Who is owner, and what are perms?
"
5316,Positive,"Ahh, yes I see. I just re-installed Crouton this morning, So I'd assume I was using the latest as it was retrieved from GitHub.. I'm installing via the x11_Freon, as we speak. I'll keep this updated until I find the best available solution.

I guess What I don't understand Is how the Tegra4Linux drivers can be compiled on Chrubuntu what stops us from installing them on Crouton?

Chrubuntu install script refferences tegra:
http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=hJWrR5Jh

Oh my goodness, I just finished the install with Xfce on Trusty Tahr.. Huge improvement. I'd honestly say this is the best i've speed i've gotten so far. Probably 3-4x better than standard Xephyr.

Basically what I did was Untar the Freon branch refferenced above (No unzip on Chomeos) so you will need a USB and unzip it on another machine. Then, I just went into the install folder and ran the Main.sh as:

chronos@localhost ~/Downloads/crouton-freonarm/installer $ sudo sh main.sh -r trusty -t xfce-desktop

Perfect so far. I will still update this as I try more work arounds.
Thanks.
"
5317,Negative,"Same issue here on an Acer Chromebook 14. Trusty and Xenial worked for five days whether using xiwi to launch a single app in a browser tab, xiwi to launch XFCE in a browser tab, or launching XFCE in a new window without xiwi.

Two days ago, launching of single apps as well as XFCE in a browser tab stopped working with a black screen and ""Press F11 to Exit Full Screen"" message as described above. Launching XFCE in new window still works for both Trusty and Xenial. 

After updating all targets in both Trusty and Xenial, I still get black screens when trying to launch in a browser tab.

"
5320,Positive,"@jakegee,

The 'precise' release has reached end-of-life and is no longer supported.
You could try upgrading your chroot to the 'xenial' release following the wiki guide: [Upgrade chroot release](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/wiki/Upgrade-chroot-release).
I want to warn you though to be sure to first back up your chroot before attempting the upgrade since it has been troublesome, for me at least, when going from 'precise' to anything newer.
In fact, you may be better off installing a fresh new 'xenial' chroot.

There is a current PR (pull request) for the 'elementary' target, it's not been reviewed and merged yet but I've gotten it to work, see [this comment](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/pull/2973#issuecomment-274998342) for details.

*Hope this helps,*

The update is interrupted with an error due to skypeforlinux (which had stopped working with a Microsoft message that it is no longer supported) but I never removed the package.

Had been using trusty OK but now am unable to mount and start xfce4 with the same problem first reported here. It would appear to me that my chroot is not fixed due to the skype error?

If this is the culprit how can I get past it? I can't use apt-get since chroot is not mounted.
Any help is greatly appreciated.

Noticed now this issue was closed - please let me know if I should have opened a new issue. 
thank you again - stuck in the mud."
5326,Neutral,"Please try the latest version of crouton and re-open if this is still an issue.
"
5327,Neutral,"Honestly, I've made no progress on this other than to determine that I have quite a bit to learn.  The idea of running the x-server inside a sandbox without emulating the kernel just won't work.  At least I don't think so.  I am looking at other open source emulators that run inside Googles native client, and researching how to build an new emulator from the ground up.
"
5328,Positive,"Oops, so _that's_ what it does... :)
"
5329,Neutral,"Okay, we're seeing massive issues with the Intel video driver in dev channel.
"
5330,Neutral,"For reference, the Debian bug above was marked as fixed, and xbindkeys 1.8.6 is now in sid. Hopefully, it will make its way to jessie in the near future.

In the mean time, we can stick with manually downloading 1.8.5 in jessie (users are not likely to hit the bug).
"
5331,Positive,"@spafindoople,

Please try the 'trusty' or 'xenial' release by using the '-r [RELEASE]' option when installing.
'precise' is quite old and will soon be replaced by 'xenial' once some issues have been worked out.

*Hope this helps,*

5332,Positive,"Thanks for the command to enter chroot.

Tried to remove xserver xorg legacy but not installed.

Only xserver-xorg newest versio 17718. How to downgrade?

5333,Neutral,"Almost sounds like you've configured your VM without the no execute bit enabled.
"
5334,Positive,"A hacky workaround is to install cpulimit and run the command:
sudo cpulimit -b -l 10 -p PID_OF_CRAS

it limits the cpu to 10%. Your audio will sometimes hang, make weird noises, and repeat a few times. It will recover eventually, but at least it won't kill my battery or make it run very hot. Youtube videos try to sync audio so the video will keep stuttering. strangely enough ChromeOS will run just fine with cras limited.

Thanks for your information, I saw post #37 that also complained about the patch not being merged into update 39 and talking about the c720's specifically. I really hope update 40 comes out soon.
"
5335,Neutral,"I guess if it turns out to be too difficult you could install ChrUbuntu either internally or on an external drive and do it there.
"
5336,Neutral,"Does it also happen if you hit left or right on an empty line?
"
5337,Neutral,"The issue as I currently see this:
**Intel Celeron Chromebooks** (tested Acer 720p/Samsung Chromebook 3/Acer Chromebook 14) work (probably without acceleration) with changes in comment [#2926](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/2926#issuecomment-268414152). See [#2917](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/2917#issuecomment-267411158) for a longer discussion. 
**ARM Chromebooks** (tested by @AntiochInteractiveMedia on CB Acer R13, see [#2926 comment](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/2926#issuecomment-269165182) )

There are exceptions listed to this (as I read them in this thread). A partial list of exceptions that need to be investigated further:
Acer CB R11 [(1 instance)](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/2926#issuecomment-269460712)
Toshiba CB 2 [(1 instance)](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/2917#issuecomment-267742510) - This case has an ambiguity between i3/Celeron
Asus C300 [(1 instance)](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/2926#issuecomment-269787889) - Ambiguity between Atom/Celeron and probably uses [#2926 comment](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/2926#issuecomment-269165182) as the fix.

**Also a great suggestion for** [**Celeron HW Acceleration**](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/2917#issuecomment-269906678) from @pmarkkula. I have tested this on both Acer 720p and Samsung CB 3."
5338,Negative,"What I am gather is that I need to edit a file within Crouton to use modesetting user-space driver instead of fbdev. Although, I am very new to this and I'm not exactly sure what to do. Could you walk me through the moving parts of the system. I'm just getting into Ubuntu, Crouton... well everything. 
"
5339,Neutral,"ps. I‘m in CLI（using enter-chroot )，when I use startxfce4，in the terminal emulator, it's fine.
"
5340,Neutral,"After reporting my issue, I saw that this one had been closed earlier today: #3010 . I hadn't noticed the solution another R11 user posted there:

`Section ""Device""
Identifier ""Intel Graphics""
Driver ""intel""
EndSection`

Tried editing my `/etc/crouton/xorg-intel-sna.conf` this way in my Kali-rolling chroot, and have been able to get back in so far. I'll keep using it and see if that holds. [UPDATE: Rebooted after toting my machine home, and the problem is back, so the edit I used is apparently not a solution in my case.]"
5341,Negative,"It succeeds to get the tty :(

I run pycharm.sh from the file explorer directly, so I guess it uses xfce-terminal (or whatever is default), no terminal is displayed. I can try running it through a visible terminal if that might help diagnose this?

To be honest its not that annoying, I don't really need to use getpass.getpass so the hang is avoidable, but I am really interested to know the cause behind this.
"
5342,Negative,"@tedm You're right, after putting xscreensaver back on and playing around a bit I am still having the horrible glitches in chromeos after using Luna for a while in a session.
"
5343,Neutral,"@brownburr - sorry, just seeing this now. sure, i'd love to help, but perhaps not relevant to this thread. and [the instructions here on crouton under the README.md](http://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/) are pretty explicit and good. if you want, click on my icon, go to my [github profile page](http://github.com/faddah/) and see my e-mail there and please e-mail me directly, and we can take it from there. 

by the way, everyone else - i now have a full ubuntu linux 14.04 LTS with unity running off a class 10/ufs 1 SD Card in my Chromebook. i basically did an entire new re-install of pretty much the same stuff using the `-p` option to install it to the SD Card, but i left off xbmc. xbmc, from what i can see in the issues here (i did a search back) seems to have massive issues that bork your linux install nearly every time xorg upgrades. there are plenty of other media players for linux, so i'd say just avoid xbmc, for now, until someone get wind they've managed to resolve this. also, the 8.1 GB limitation was my mistake - that was a linux drive that gets installed when you do a linux install, but the rest of the drive gets used as linux too. so there you go.

so i'm closing this all out — though i do recommend adding somewhere in the crouton README.md that people add xbmc into the mix in a crouton install at their own risk, due the the fact that every time xorg updates, xbmc can bork your linux install and you're not able to get back in.

closing this out.

best,

"
5344,Neutral,"It also works fine on 1920x1080. Maybe it's something related to XFCE not supporting 1536x864?
"
5345,Neutral,"I think we need to use the chrome.tabs API instead of the generic window one to open the URL.  In particular, if you special-case an empty URL, you can pass nothing to [tabs.create](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs#method-create) (literally, an empty object) and it will open the appropriate new tab page for you.
"
5346,Positive,"Also, what is the danger of running `sudo` inside a chroot? I did not entirely get that part. Thanks for the quick reply, as well."
5347,Negative,"I have the exact same issue as David here, and is there any way to make the flicker stop when you come cack to out  of sleep mode? It's been kind of tedious to reboot over and over again. I'm not a very good fan of crouton integration, since my linux gets laggy. Running trusty xfce. 
"
5348,Positive,"@air Are you using docker inside crouton? I don't think docker can work inside a chroot environment.

There are pre-built docker binary [here](https://docs.docker.com/installation/binaries/), you can copy it to /usr/local/bin and have fun!
"
5349,Neutral,"From crosh, either run:
- `sudo startxfce4`
- OR `sudo enter-chroot`, followed by `startxfce4` (no sudo here)
"
5350,Neutral,"i get the message

AIGLX: Suspending AIGLX clients for VT switch

"
5351,Positive,"See [this issue/topic](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/1920) by me. You might try to **stop** your Linux chroot to (auto)mount removable devices by: 
1. sudo dconf-editor
2. Browse to org.gnome.desktop.media-handling and disable automount (and automount-open)
3. Do that both as root and ""yourself"".

Worked for getting write accress to the SD card for me. :)

5357,Neutral,"I also came across this issue, and for me it was due to locale settings (my language was set to ""C"" after setting up xenial). If you run `sudo locale` and get output anything like this:

Follow this up by appending this to `/etc/default/locale` and `/etc/environment`

croagh install took a while but went fine and targets kde & xfce did well, unity was kind of bare and, of course didn't log out but all went well, even did a croagh update and no problems.

5367,Neutral,"Mostly likely duplicate of: https://github.com/headmelted/code-builds/issues/12, https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/3098 & https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/3083"
5368,Neutral,"@theadamgreen1 : Basically, audio that is routed straight to Chrome Audio Server (CRAS) is working fine, but there is a problem when it is routed through pulseaudio first. I have not been able to reproduce on Acer C720, dev channel (5764.0.0). I'll try beta channel.

What you can try (in this order):
- Reboot the Chromebook and try again (but I suspect you did that already...)
- Try out `precise` or `trusty` instead of `saucy` (it looks like you also tried that)
- Switch back to Chrome OS stable channel (that'll require a powerwash: backup your data), or dev channel.
"
5369,Neutral,"Roll-out is ongoing; should be fixed within a few hours.
"
5370,Neutral,"Hm. So, in the last failure I posted, https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/2688#issuecomment-250607576, I received this error:

```
E: Method http has died unexpectedly!
E: Sub-process http received signal 4.
```

instead of the usual

```
E: Method http has died unexpectedly!
E: Sub-process http received a segmentation fault.
```

A `signal 4`, if you run `kill -l` in your terminal, refers to a `SIGILL` being sent to a process to terminate it. `SIGILL` is a signal that means the process performed an ""illegal instruction,"" as you can see if you read `man signal`. It seems that, most often, this signal is triggered when a process attempts to perform an operation that is specific to a processor architecture different from/not supported by your machine's processor.

Another possibility could be that pieces of the executable code are being overwritten in memory with some other mess of data, or that a function pointer in the program points to similar unintelligible data.

Disclaimer: I literally know next to nothing about this stuff, and I mostly just read about it for a couple hours this morning, so I might be totally wrong. 

If the first case is true, and the sub-process `http` is attempting a processor-specific optimization that is not supported by the processor in the R11, I guess the solution would be to manually compile apt-get (?) on your own machine.

If the second case is true, and since there's a decent amount of evidence it's related to memory usage, maybe some RAM is being overwritten when `http` still needs to access it? Does that make sense? Or maybe some area of memory is being overwritten or altered or compressed that the `http` process wants to access? The swap functionality on Chromebooks, being enabled by default, does not write to a swap partition on the SSD. Instead, it uses [zram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zram), which writes to compressed [block device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_file#BLOCKDEV) in RAM, which takes up less memory overall (?) than the normal [paging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging) in virtual memory.

So maybe at high memory usage, zram unknowingly swaps some memory at addresses that the `http` sub-process still needs to access, making it read what seems like garbage data instead, and triggering either an _illegal instruction_ signal (if it thinks the bytes it reads signify an incompatible instruction) or a _segmentation fault_ (because it's accessing/pointing to memory that it's not allowed to access). Maybe disabling swap on the machine will help?

I will try, at some point, to disable swap and see if that helps, and also try recompiling the apt-get binaries (not sure how to do this, but I'm sure I can figure that out) to see if that will work.

Again, disclaimer, I don't know if what I'm saying makes sense. I'm a chemist, not a computer scientist. I'm sure as hell not a C programmer, and the extent of my knowledge on operating systems reaches only to the Wikipedia pages, Stack Overflow questions, and various forums that I come across when following a Wild Google Chase.

Does anyone have a better understanding of this?

On my HP Chromebook, I've running Steam in Saucy without issues. Even light gaming is possible :dancers: ..Maybe you are no seeing your host computer due some dns - ""discovery"" issues (not all packages of regular Ubuntu seems to be installed(?)). I don't know if there is a possibility, but did you tried using an IP to connect with the host?
"
5384,Neutral,"The ARM Chromebook's X server has some hacks to improve performance.  crouton has a hack of its own to get around this, using ratpoison.  Install crouton with `-t xephyr` at a minimum (xfce, unity, etc, all include this by default on ARM), then enter the chroot and run croutonwm to enable the hack (running xinit or starting xfce/unity/etc runs this by default as well).

5387,Neutral,"The particular problem you're having is due to Minecraft's dependency on some libraries that are built for x86 (`liblwjgl64.so`). But even getting past that, there won't be any 3D acceleration on ARM (at least with Mali graphics) so the game itself will be unplayable.
"
5388,Positive,"Ah ok nice it works for you. BTW I think the newest virtualbox version should also work.  
To avoid confusion you don't build the kernel headers, they were build by me. You just installed them by running the script setup-headers.sh.
This script will: 
- add my signing key with which the packages are signed.
- add the ppa to the sources.list.d (/etc/apt/sources.list.d/crouton-packages.list)
- install linux-headers-
- install linux-image-
- add a rc.local script to load vboxdrv modules on entering the chroot if they are available.

Seems there is an issue then when building the kernel-headers with recent source. I will see if I can replicate and if something significant has changed in the kernel config.

You have a 'precise' chroot so that line shouldn't be needed, but it can't hurt either.
It should **not** be set to trusty though.

> still no love

Cute, but I'd like to see the output of your DEBUG log that's created in `/tmp/`.
You should have a file in /tmp named crouton-$PID.log (the $PID will be whatever process number started it) that will show you where it failed.

"
5399,Neutral,"@dnschneid To get crouton play well with PID 1, I suggest to refactor enter-chroot into separate parts:
1. Arguments and environment variables parsing, including $USER/$BACKGROUND/$NOLOGIN...
2. Changes need for the host, including disablehungtask/Allow X server running as normal user, and so on.
3. bindmount/tmpfsmount. Minijail can do all the bindmount atomically together with chroot. We could collect all the need task in bindmount{}, and delay the mount until chroot is to be called, so it behaves more similar to minijail.
4. job after chroot. This include launching system dbus. I expect that we will do less and less work in this part, but delegate the work to PID 1(sysvinit/upstart/openrc at the moment, and hopefully systemd eventually). 
  I hope the last part will be more declarative in style, maybe similar to inittab.

This refactoring will be very helpful for all kinds of experiments. Currently my minijail/unshare tricks only deal with 3, so I can not integrate part 1,2,4,   thus not able to start dbus/X11 for further experiments.

Should I open a separate issue for this?

Update: I'm not familiar with bash scripts, so the [-n $var}/[ -z $var]/${2:-""$1""} thing really drive me crazy. Chromeos already include python, so why not use python for enter-chroot?

Update 2: tmpfsmount and ""ln -sfT"" should be done inside chroot

5402,Neutral,"Though the wisdom of this functionality is unclear,
it would make sense if setting `DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT` to zero, or `None` would in fact mean 'infinite' in accordance with other settings such as `CLOSESPIDER_TIMEOUT`, `CLOSESPIDER_ITEMCOUNT` et cetera.

The current `ScrapyAgent` source reads

``` python
timeout = request.meta.get('download_timeout') or self._connectTimeout
```

where zero and `None` are false and invoke `self._connectTimeout` instead.
Aside from this, `reactor.callLater(0, ...)` would mean ""asap"" instead of ""never"", so this would need a different codepath.

5405,Neutral,"Current behavior of Scrapy when finding links like: 
  /fclick.php?variable

is to canonicalize them to:
  /fclick.php?variable=

This however makes Scrapy follow an incorrect link and cause an error page to load. This is really fault of web script programmers really who use variables without value. But for the sake of robustness Scrapy should follow the correct links.

I made a small patch for this. All it does really is that when it faces variables with 0 length value it crops out the =.

5407,Neutral,"Pages which have duplicate values in their query string are treated as different pages:
- http://www.example.com/?q=
- http://www.example.com/?q=&q=

If the first page has a link to the second and the second a link to the third, `scrapy` enters an infinite loop, requesting each page in succession. I've put a simple page [here](http://fcoelho.alwaysdata.net/scrapy/page.php) to test the issue. Using a CrawlSpider with a rule like `Rule(SgmlLinkExtractor(), callback='parse_page', follow=True)` will cause this infinite recursion. Here is a sample spider:

``` python
from scrapy.contrib.spiders import CrawlSpider, Rule
from scrapy.contrib.linkextractors.sgml import SgmlLinkExtractor

class LoopingSpider(CrawlSpider):
    name = ""loop""
    start_urls = [""http://fcoelho.alwaysdata.net/scrapy/page.php""]

It seems like in the end the problem ""arises"" because `scrapy.utils.url.canonicalize_url` only sorts the query string keys, but don't remove duplicates. As far as I can tell, duplicates are ""wrong"", and shouldn't be counted as normal web page behavior. Would it be sane to remove arguments from the query string if their key is repeated?

5411,Neutral,"Hey,

I think that @redapple is right in https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/488 that base spider template needs more imports by default, but IMHO introducing more code generation is not a solution.

Scrapy top-level namespace is a bit funky now: 

```
>>> import scrapy
>>> dir(scrapy)
['__builtins__',
 '__doc__',
 '__file__',
 '__name__',
 '__package__',
 '__path__',
 '__version__',

 'pkgutil',
 'print_function',
 'sys',
 'twisted_version',
 'urlparse_monkeypatches',
 'version_info',
 'warnings',
 'xlib']
```

it contains boto and django, but doesn't contain shortcuts like Request, Selector and BaseSpider. What do you think about making them available as `scrapy.Request` etc and removing unintended exports? 

Currently to write a basic spider user has to remember a lot of import locations. Scrapy docs omit imports sometimes (see #493), this also doesn't help.

My current list is BaseSpider (why isn't it named Spider, by the way?), Request, FormRequest and Selector, but I don't see much downsides in being more generous (Item? Field?).

"
5415,Neutral,"I needed to download some autogenerated datasheets (in PDF format), and I decided to go with the FilesPipeline provided within Scrapy.

However, the URL structure didn't follow the assumption of the `file_path` method in the `FilesPipeline` class (a well structured filename, i.e. `example.pdf`):

Here is a snippet of my spider:

``` python
item['file_urls'] = []
item['file_urls'].append(""https://www.domain.name/path/path/DatasheetService?control=%3C%3Fxml+version%3D%221.0%22+encoding%3D%22UTF-8%22%3F%3E%3Cpdf_generator_control%3E%3Cmode%3EPDF%3C%2Fmode%3E%3Cpdmsystem%3EPMD%3C%2Fpdmsystem%3E%3Ctemplate_selection+mlfb%3D%22{}%22+system%3D%22PRODIS%22%2F%3E%3Clanguage%3Ees%3C%2Flanguage%3E%3Ccaller%3EMall%3C%2Fcaller%3E%3C%2Fpdf_generator_control%3E"".format(item['code']))
```

This is the code that extracts the media extension from the URL ( in scrapy.contrib.pipeline.files.FilesPipeline):

``` python
media_ext = os.path.splitext(url)[1]  # change to request.url after deprecation
```

Now, the value of `media_ext` for my URL is

``` txt
.0%22+encoding%3D%22UTF-8%22%3F%3E%3Cpdf_generator_control%3E%3Cmode%3EPDF%3C%2Fmode%3E%3Cpdmsystem%3EPMD%3C%2Fpdmsystem%3E%3Ctemplate_selection+mlfb%3D%22CODE%22+system%3D%22PRODIS%22%2F%3E%3Clanguage%3Ees%3C%2Flanguage%3E%3Ccaller%3EMall%3C%2Fcaller%3E%3C%2Fpdf_generator_control%3E
```

Which is not only an incorrect extension type, but also results (in this particular case) in an IOException (filename too long).

One quick way to fix this is appending something like `&type=.pdf` to the URL while constructing the `file_urls` list:

``` python
item['file_urls'] = []
item['file_urls'].append(""https://www.domain.name/path/path/DatasheetService?control=%3C%3Fxml+version%3D%221.0%22+encoding%3D%22UTF-8%22%3F%3E%3Cpdf_generator_control%3E%3Cmode%3EPDF%3C%2Fmode%3E%3Cpdmsystem%3EPMD%3C%2Fpdmsystem%3E%3Ctemplate_selection+mlfb%3D%22{}%22+system%3D%22PRODIS%22%2F%3E%3Clanguage%3Ees%3C%2Flanguage%3E%3Ccaller%3EMall%3C%2Fcaller%3E%3C%2Fpdf_generator_control%3E&type=.pdf"".format(item['code']))
```

However, I think it would be helpful to introduce some code that (optionally) guesses the extension out of the response headers:
- First, it checks the `Content-Type` header and uses the `mimetypes` module to guess the extension. 
- Second, if the previous step fails it checks the `Content-Disposition` header.
- Third, if the previous step fails it uses the standard implementation.

This would be useful in the case that the crawler gets a list of URLs by some other means (i.e. using an XPath query).

[Here](https://github.com/ldgarcia/scrapy/commit/a01f24900b3a454f4b09f594a6d529da14394367) is my approach, and I'd be happy to open a PR if you like the idea and the implementation.

This issue manifests when mixing old paths and new ones for extensions and middlewares (this can happen for example while using a newer version of Scrapy in a project that hasn't updated to the new paths yet). Since paths aren't normalized, the same component can be loaded twice.

Take these settings for example:

``` python
# scrapy/settings/default_settings.py
EXTENSIONS_BASE = {
    'scrapy.extensions.debug.StackTraceDump': 100,  # new path
} 
```

``` python
# myproject/settings.py
EXTENSIONS = {
    'scrapy.contrib.debug.StackTraceDump': 200,  # old path

While merging both dictionaries to build the list of components, the same StackTraceDump class is going to be loaded twice since it appears in two different keys.

5433,Neutral,"As discussed here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21177090/scrapy-gets-stuck-with-iis-5-1-page , having almost identical applications but being served with different versions of IIS makes scrapy unable to scrap the one served with IIS 5.1.

Why I think as this is related with IIS 5.1 servers: as discussed here http://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=2184 , IIS 5.1 returns HTTP 100 after every POST request, breaking some automated HTTP clients. It might be the case for scrapy also.

Long story short, how to reproduce the issue:
- Find a webpage with a form being served with IIS 5.1
- Create a spider that makes a FormRequest to the form
- Run the spider
- Scrapy will keep getting timeouts after sending the POST request

But forcing HTTP 1.0 by adding

```
DOWNLOAD_HANDLERS = {
    'http': 'scrapy.core.downloader.handlers.http10.HTTP10DownloadHandler',
    'https': 'scrapy.core.downloader.handlers.http10.HTTP10DownloadHandler',
}
```

to settings.py seems to solve the problem.

Shouldn't the spider work with the default (HTTP 1.1) handler?

P.S: Using Scrapy 0.20.2 (pip-installed)
"
5434,Neutral,"A comment in the code of RetryMiddleware says

```
    # IOError is raised by the HttpCompression middleware when trying to
    # decompress an empty response
```

when including IOError in the exceptions to retry.

But IOError would be raised in HttpCompressionMiddleware's `process_response()`, errors from which are not handled by `process_exception()` in downloader middlewares.

5435,Positive,"Hi,

I know there is a feature to resume Scrapy job, but it turns out, if I force close the spider by clicking Ctrl+C twice, it fails to resume. To be honest that makes the resume feature not that useful.

What I want to ask is, can Scrapy survive a crash and resume the last batch? 

Thanks,

5449,Neutral,"`MapCompose` class uses `arg_to_iter` function ([link](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/343f997ed6a20241480316c6d24490f071a3b524/scrapy/contrib/loader/processor.py#L27)) with processed values.
`arg_to_iter` check if value is container or not [with such method](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/343f997ed6a20241480316c6d24490f071a3b524/scrapy/utils/misc.py#L21):

```
hasattr(arg, '__iter__')
```

Im oftenly pass `lxml.html.HtmlElement` instances through processors and use `MapCompose` with them. But instances of this class have attribute `__iter__`, and they are not being wrapped into `list`, so they are treated as iterables, and `MapCompose` iterates over children of an `HtmlElement` breaking inteded low.

One workaround comes to mind - is to use facilitating processor that would wrap all `HtmlElements` into lists.

But I think, it is better to replace check in `arg_to_iter` to

```
isinstance(arg, (list, tuple))
```

Because it is more explicit, and would ensure, that such things as I described will never happen.
"
5450,Neutral,"This is from a quick brain dump in another PR, I'm putting it here for some discuss-ability.

In effect we only have `Response` and`TextResponse` any longer. `HTMLResponse` and `XMLResponse` classes are only leftover faces, their functionality merged into `TextResponse`.
Instancing Text, Html or XmlResponse is the same thing by a different name.
It could make more sense to use a `mime` property on the response for such type inferral.

We could turn Response into `BinaryResponse` (still being a superclass for `TextResponse`), and create a new `Response` class with the logic to build either Text- or BinaryResponse instances.
This is essentially what `ResponseTypes` currently does, and we might rename that (and clean up the types), with it's `from_args` method as default behavior.

Then somebody can ""feel lucky"" and instance a `Response`, probably getting back the correct type, or they can pick either `TextResponse` or `BinaryResponse` directly.
Additionally we would have `Response.from_content_type()` and other methods directly in the Response class (maybe rename to `Response.type_from_...()` ).

I think that might be nice because the detection logic of `ResponseTypes` seems under-used and appreciated, it's used by the system but not much advertised for custom Spider development.
"
5451,Neutral,"Currently File/Image pipelines populate `files`/`images` fields with dicts containing information about the downloaded files (the downloaded path, the original scraped url, and the file checksum). It would be useful to have downloaded/uptodate status in this dict ([motivation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45823196/scrapy-how-to-get-status-of-file-download)).

It goes along with other features requests such as having width/height of images also in the dict output."
5452,Neutral,"Currently, Scrapy forces the user to define a spider in order to start scraping any site, but given all execution is centered around requests and callbacks, I think there should be an option to use Scrapy without defining a spider explicitly.

For instance, below is a subclass of `CrawlerProcess` which allows to start crawling with only an URL and a callback function:

``` python
from scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess as _CrawlerProcess
from scrapy.http import Request


class CrawlerProcess(_CrawlerProcess):
    """"""This class allows to crawl an URL with a given callback without explictly creating a spider class.""""""

    def crawl(self, request_or_url, callback=None, crawler_or_spidercls=DefaultSpider,
              *spider_args, **spider_kwargs):
        if isinstance(request_or_url, basestring):
            request_or_url = Request(request_or_url, callback=callback, dont_filter=True)
        spider_kwargs['start_requests'] = lambda: [request_or_url]
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).crawl(crawler_or_spidercls, *spider_args, **spider_kwargs)
```

Then, the example given in www.scrapy.org front page could be written as:

``` python
import scrapy

def parse_blog(response):
    for url in response.css('ul li a::attr(""href"")').re(r'/\d\d\d\d/\d\d/$'):
        yield scrapy.Request(response.urljoin(url), parse_titles)

def parse_titles(response):
    for post_title in response.css('div.entries > ul > li a::text').extract():
        yield {'title': post_title}

crawler = CrawlerProcess()
crawler.crawl('http://blog.scrapinghub.com', callback=parse_blog)
crawler.start()
```

However, this approach misses all the options the `scrapy` command provides, for instance, storing the output of the spider in a file with `-o output.jl`.  And, if the user needs more advanced features, a proper spider class is required in order to take advantage of all the Scrapy features, specially the features that require a specific spider method or attribute.

```

Unfortunately, the code above could not return the right content. It seems that the `abstracttext` element cannot be recognized by Scrapy.

I tried to replace `abstracttext` with `h4`, and the script went well.

So how can I extract the content in `abstracttext`?

I run scrapy v1.1.0

I need some parts of the url to create some ids. Lately I have been noticing that response.request.url is returning a different url that the one that is used to scrape. 

In my code I use the item['LINK'] = response.request.url but that is putting in the wrong link on some scrapers like 2/10 approximately. 

Is there a better way to fetch the url? The one that is displayed in the debug scrapy output is correct. 

Thank you. 

This one outputted in the debug window is correct:

You need to call `super()` to make rules work, but that is expected - if you override something it is reasonable to call super. 

Can't comment about `parse` being default callback for Rules, I haven't used rules much. Also, I'm not sure I like that `parse` is a default callback for Request - it makes sense for requests issued in `start_requests`, but for other requests it kind-of suggests to put all code in a single callback, while usually you have multiple callbacks.

I don't see how `self.request()` could help with the absolute url problem.

5480,Neutral,"fyi, I've sent a message on Twisted Web mailing list: https://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-web/2017-April/005293.html"
5481,Neutral,"Hey @deanq, you cannot update the settings from within `Spider.__init__()`. They are marked 'immutable' long before it is called.

For per-spider settings, you can use [the Spider's `custom_settings` attribute](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#scrapy.spiders.Spider.custom_settings).

However, given that you want to read from the keyword arguments given on Spider instantiation, that won't really help you either. You could try three things:
1. **(Best)** avoid giving `maxpages` as Spider keyword argument. Maybe it is enough to provide `CLOSESPIDER_PAGECOUNT` through the command line?
2. Write your own modified CloseSpider extension by subclassing [`scrapy.extensions.closespider`](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/extensions/closespider.py), then overwrite the [`page_count()` method](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/extensions/closespider.py#L47) so that it checks against `spider.maxpages` (or similar) instead of against `self.close_on['pagecount']`.
3. ""Hack"" your keyword argument `maxpages` into the existing CloseSpider extension by circumventing the settings, e.g.:
   
   ``` python
   # in your spider
   def __init__(self, **kw):
       # You might have to change the 0 to another index depending on your enabled extensions,
       # check by printing self.crawler.extensions.middlewares somewhere
       self.crawler.extensions.middlewares[0].close_on['pagecount'] = kw.get('maxpages', 100)

5504,Neutral,"@kmike Any service that scrapes content and outputs near-raw data could be targeted by an attacker. Examples, but not limited to:
- Services that generate image or pdf from a given URL, i.e. http://snapito.com/ ;
- Services that calculate a website SEO's score (not so common these day);
- Services that provide extensive search for third parties. SaaS that does website indexing and offers custom search competing with Google's Custom Search Engine);

Any of these services could be powered by Scrapy, and an attacker could exploit them by creating traps such as `<a href=""file:///etc/passwd"">foo</a>` so that once the service iterates a sitemap or downloads whatever page where that trap is deployed to, the target spits out the data scraped.

Just to clarify, the initial point I raised:
A. HTTP redirects and html meta refresh, should only work with http[s]. So far, looks like we all agree with this one.
B. Some kind of master switch could be introduced to the settings file, making it clear that allowing requests to `file://` may result in unwanted results if `OffsiteMiddleware` is not defined or disabled or open to any domains.

You may want to look at something like [`arg_to_iter`](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/b6375d3701b72ca1ce28c32fd90741b0864db05f/scrapy/utils/misc.py#L17) which does tests for single valued arguments in a Python2/Python3 compatible way.

5515,Neutral,"> Instead of handing off relative links and hoping some middleware will fix it , I'd prefer getting an absolute URL back from the selector.

Although, I don't think selectors deserves this task, mostly because linkextractors (#559) are designed to deal with it instead, I will take a step toward this idea in the spirit of #494 and #554 and combine linkextractors into selectors API like this:

``` python
import scrapy

class Spider(scrapy.Spider):

    def parse(response):
        for lnk in response.sel.xpath('//span[@class=""breadcrumb""]').links():
            yield scrapy.Request(lnk.url)

```

here `.links()` takes the usual link extractor arguments except for restrict_xpaths.
"
5516,Positive,"Thanks @nramirezuy . I see what you meant now.
I agree and actually, only the command line option makes sense. Changing it at the project setting does not make sense either.
"
5517,Negative,"Yeah, I don't like it either. 

First idea:

``` python
>>> il = Itemloader(response=response)
>>> with il.xpath('//div') as sel: 
...    il.add_xpath('title', './/h1', selector=sel, context={'foo': 'endoftitle'}, lambda x, loader_context: x[0] + loader_context['foo'])
```

So selector and context gets overridden for that call. Then I thought people is going to bother because they have they have to type selector and stuff, so I start doing crazy stuff to workaround it in a way you can type:

``` python
>>> il = Itemloader(response=response)
>>> with il.xpath('//div'): 
...    il.add_xpath('title', './/h1', context={'foo': 'endoftitle'}, lambda x, loader_context: x[0] + loader_context['foo'])
```

The main problem is that I want `xpath` to return a `Selector` and not a `ContextManager`.
"
5518,Neutral,"Hm, I think it still makes sense to use it by default; Google deprecated this scheme because its crawlers can handle JavaScript now, but Scrapy can't do that, and so relying on `_escaped_fragment_` is better than nothing.

5522,Negative,"I was able to emulate a similar issue touching some settings, I couldn't reproduce it otherwise in the attached project.

Problem here seems unrelated to the system locale. Both log calls, the one in utils/log.py and the one in core/engine.py, try to log an unicode message. By doing that all attributes in the log record are decoded to unicode using the ascii encoding, and that breaks with the reported traceback if there are any non-ascii characters.

The values in the broken line are roughly:

``` python
>>> _fmt = '%(asctime)s [%(name)s] %(levelname)s: %(message)s'
>>> record = {
    'asctime': '2015-06-02 12:17:01+0000',
    'created': 1433258457.911135,
    'exc_info': None,
    'exc_text': None,
    'filename': 'log.py',
    'funcName': 'log_scrapy_info',
    'levelname': 'INFO',
    'levelno': 20,
    'lineno': 108,
    'module': log,
    'msecs': 911.1349582672119,
    'message': u'Scrapy 1.1.0rc1 started (bot: imzx)',
    'name': 'scrapy',
    'pathname': 'scrapy/utils/log.py',
    'process': 19931,
    'processName': 'MainProcess',
    'relativeCreated': 66988981.72998428,
    'thread': 139932245554944,
    'threadName': 'MainThread'}
}
>>> s = _fmt % record
```

Since `'message'` is unicode, all `'asctime'`, `'name'` and `'levelname'` (and only those) in the record dictionary are going to be casted to unicode using the ascii encoding while formatting them into `_fmt`, which is going to be casted to unicode too. If any of those has non-ascii chars, the conversion is going to break with the UnicodeDecodeError.

Problem is, I don't know how any of those could hold non-ascii characters. The default `'asctime'` format is `'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S%z'`, those placeholders format into numbers regardless locale. All these values are bytestrings handled by us, which are encoded by the default file encoding (ascii in python2) unless stated otherwise at the beginning of the file.

Something that I tested to trigger these errors was to install scrapy in a path with non-ascii characters, and then change the default format with the LOG_FORMAT setting to `'[%(pathname)s] %(message)s'`. Doing this the logging breaks every time a unicode message is logged, but this is something expected of the python logging since it's using bytestrings internally to store the pathname.

@binbibi, can I ask you to run the following commands (notice the leading `u` in both messages, both calls are logging unicode) and see if any of these calls throws errors? I'm really sorry for the troubles. 

``` python
>>> import logging
>>> logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s [%(name)s] %(levelname)s: %(message)s')
>>> logging.warning(u'First log message')
```

``` python
>>> import logging
>>> from scrapy.utils.log import configure_logging
>>> configure_logging({})
>>> logger = logging.getLogger('scrapy')
>>> logger.debug(u'Second message')
```

5558,Positive,"@redapple , I pulled the changes you made and I was doing some testing. So far I haven't seen any issues and that change actually fixed the issue. Thanks for the quick response and the fix. Now I see clear messages in the logs too which is very helpful.
"
5559,Neutral,"Here's a gist with my modified `HttpCompressionMiddleware.process_response`: https://gist.github.com/295df3142597fd1e2aa594b8f7bed75a

I'm not proud of it, since it's an ugly hack. But i guess it points to `responsetypes.from_args` as the bug source.
"
5560,Neutral,"do you mean `/usr/local/bin/scrapy` exists after installing with pip?

If so, add `/usr/local/bin` to PATH environment variable or create symlink from /usr/bin/ like:

```
ln -s /usr/local/bin/scrapy /usr/bin/
```

5561,Neutral,"please, route question like this to Scrapy mailing list http://groups.google.com/group/scrapy-users/ 
"
5562,Neutral,"@Digenis I think there is no need for aggressive removals of deprecated code. IMHO we definitely shouldn't remove code and modules deprecated in 0.24 during 1.1 release.

5563,Neutral,"Do you mean, how to contribute? 

May be this? http://doc.scrapy.org/en/master/contributing.html
"
5564,Neutral,"Hey @Anlight,

Please use http://stackoverflow.com (with tag [scrapy](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scrapy)) or scrapy-users Google group (less popular) for support questions.
"
5565,Neutral,Fixed by #2590 
5566,Neutral,"Currently, when the crawling doesn't even start (say, because of an exception in some `__init__` or `__new__` method) the exit code is set to 1, allowing for `scrapy crawl stuff || handle error` expressions in the shell.
"
5567,Neutral,"Hi, Phil, i already implemented the functionality, but in order to include in scrapy i have to implement tests too. The code is published in my copy of scrapy repository, here https://github.com/kalessin/scrapy/commits/ftphandler I just pushed it, so it is available for anyone while tests are not implemented. I plan to add it in short time, but i am open to colaboration for that.
"
5568,Neutral,"Based on the gist it seems you don't need to change anything on Scrapy side to use this feature. Could you check if it is true?
"
5569,Neutral,"For now you can use `Autothrottle`. You just need to override [`_response_downloaded`](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/extensions/throttle.py#L40) and do something [like](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/downloadermiddlewares/httpcache.py#L41).

I'll encourage you to make a PR with this feature, it might be useful for someone else.
"
5570,Negative,"I think we can do nothing in Scrapy to fix it; it looks like a gevent bug or gevent incompatibility with Twisted.
"
5571,Neutral,"Aside of referencing your findings from a FAQ entry, the only long term solution I can think is in the lines of #1435.
"
5572,Negative,"Hey @jorenham,

There are no required methods in scrapy pipelines, middlewares and extensions, all methods are optional. So the tricky part is to figure out what should these base classes contain. We also need to make sure pipelines/middleware/extensions which are not subclasses of these base classes still work.

The current solution to documentation problem is to generate extension/middleware/pipeline templates, with all these methods - each new Scrapy project has them.

But I also find myself looking at docs each time I'm implementing a middleware or a pipeline, I feel the pain. Also, sometimes you have a middlewares.py file with a middleware and it is not immediately clear if it is a downloader or a spider middleware; inheriting from a certain class could help with readability."
5573,Neutral,"@lagenar , we added #1629 to 1.1 milestone, so hopefully the core devs will agree on a good solution for most cases.
By the way, the custom context factory works for https://www.buyagift.co.uk/, so one more point for #1629
"
5574,Neutral,"I'm pretty sure the issue is `pip` installed your scrapy executable to a path that is not within your $PATH.
"
5575,Positive,"Thanks for reporting @starrify
Is it the same as https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/2304 ?

5576,Negative,"Also having the same problem, the site I am scraping requires that the commas do not get encoded, i.e. http://url/1,2,3.html, which through the safe_url encoding gets changed.  Having a hard time getting it to work, even with senarvi and DanMcInerney's workarounds.

Would be great to have an option to disable safe_url for certain spiders. 
"
5577,Neutral,"See also: https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/482.

Pipeline doesn't bypass website concurrency limits, but requests are sent directly to Downloader, without putting them to Scheduler - this indeed means they are all in-memory."
5578,Neutral,"In that case the docs are a little misleading.
http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/logging.html

Logging from spiders is 'recommended' to be done using the spiders' log() method. But the docs don't disregard using the log module normally, in fact it is mentioned right after how to do it.

In any case, pipelines are modules where a lot data output occurs, they typical usage scenario for logging. How do I log from a pipeline without calling the log constructor? Is it not possible by design?

Is the log module intended to be used only scrapy's core? If so, I suggest to moving that part of the documentation to the right section as it is clearly misplaced/misleading.
"
5579,Neutral,"You need to render javascript. One solution is [scrapy-splash - it integrates Scrapy spiders with headless browser - Splash](https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash). [Here is nice tutorial](https://blog.scrapinghub.com/2015/03/02/handling-javascript-in-scrapy-with-splash/) about using it.

Sometimes you don't really need to render Javascript. If these vue templates are filled with some data fetched with ajax request it is often enough to just make proper api call get JSON and parse it. this is often easier than rendering full page."
5580,Neutral,"Can you explain how it makes sub classing slightly easier? Just by avoiding the import? or there is something else I'm missing.
"
5581,Neutral,"@redapple: yes, that would be nice to have that kind of functionality.
For the record, the workaround I use in the meantime is to force the timezone with a `TZ=UTC` environment variable and with `LOG_DATEFORMAT = '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'` where `Z` is hardcoded."

"
5583,Neutral,"@mvsantos: I understand the issue but must say Scrapy defaults are set to ease development, and tuned in production in a per case basis. 

As a general rule It's recommended to run spiders in constrained environments, limited in memory, CPU and filesystem access, and this environments makes access to local files a derisory issue.

Disabling `file://` by default will become a common gotcha for local development. 
What about adding a ""Recommendation for running spiders in production"" page to docs? 
"
5584,Neutral,"Also if you are calling this [`log.start()`](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/log.py#L122) you are overriding the settings, the `Crawler` works because it calls it [from](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/log.py#L160)

"
5597,Negative,"I can confirm that 1.1.0rc3 does not work on OSX (it no longer throws an exception so at least there's progress). I'm almost positive that the issue is with the openssl version as it's 0.9.8zg and on linux it's using a newer 1.0.2 version. I've updated openssl via homebrew and tried to reinstall pyopenssl via:

``` bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/pip
pip uninstall cryptography
ARCHFLAGS=""-arch x86_64"" LDFLAGS=""-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib"" CFLAGS=""-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include"" pip install cryptography
```

but it didn't seem to use the newer homebrew version. I may have done something else stupid though.
"
5598,Positive,"@Digenis that's a good question. Our options:
1. Release Scrapy 1.1 without these backwards incompatible changes, follow semver (create a branch, cherry-pick commits);
2. Declare 1.1 'unstable' (but I don't see a point of doing such release, compared to just using master);
3. Decide that these incompatibilities are in fact bug fixes and release 1.1 as-is (maybe without #1149).

""scrapy hasn't reached 1.0"" is outdated (see https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/1541)

5600,Neutral,"Hi,

Sorry for (may off-the-topic?) interruption.
I've noticed that ftp links are not recognized either. 

E.g., the following code prints no links (an empty list `[]`).

```python
from scrapy.http import HtmlResponse
from scrapy.linkextractors import LinkExtractor
hrsp = HtmlResponse(body=b""""""<html>
<body>
<a href=""ftp://www.external.com/"">another site</a>
</body>
</html>
"""""", url=""http://www.example.com/index.html"")
print(LinkExtractor().extract_links(hrsp))
```

The root cause seems a line of module `linkextractor`s (`/scrapy/linkextractors/__init__.py:44`):
```
_is_valid_url = lambda url: url.split('://', 1)[0] in {'http', 'https', 'file'}
```

I hope this will help.

I am not sure, the change is backwards incompatible and likely less performant than current implementation.

Unless well argued I don't think we should cahnge it, instead we provide the flexibility to use a different implementation in Request class without requiring to reimplement its methods, a class level attribute that defaults to current Headers class should be enough.

```

Or if you want to write your own downloader middleware, just subclass from `object`. See also: https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html

Could you please try asking in English in the future? Cuz currently we're not supporting other languages on this issue tracker.

### Chinese Version

你好, 目前并不存在这个 `scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.DownloaderMiddleware`
请问你是在什么地方需要用到它呢?

如果你需要使用现有的下载器中间件(downloader middleware), 请访问 https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/tree/master/scrapy/downloadermiddlewares 来获取内置的下载器中间件列表并直接使用它们的路径, 例如:
```
>>> import scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.cookies
>>> scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.cookies.CookiesMiddleware
<class 'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.cookies.CookiesMiddleware'>
```

或者如果你希望编写你自己的下载器中间件, 请注意目前它们不需要有指定的公共父类, 请直接从 `object` 继承就可以了. 参见 https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html (中文版本文档: http://scrapy-chs.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html)

5638,Neutral,"Hi @johncadigan,

I think that the code in sciscrapy is too specific to be included in Scrapy itself. As it doesn't require changes to Scrapy it can be maintained as a separate project. This has many advantages, e.g. releases won't be tied to Scrapy release schedule (so you can make them faster), Scrapy developers will have less code to support, and Scrapy won't become dependent on numpy/scipy/scikit-learn.

Some feedback (after a quick look):
- there are temporary `.py~` files, I think they shouldn't be in a repo;
- I believe a lot of code from classifier.py and features.py can be replaced with scikit-learn utilities - have you checked FeatureUnion, DictVectorizer and scoring/cross-validation utilities?

"
5640,Neutral,"`FEED_EXPORT_FIELDS` option was added for 2 main reasons:
1. It is not possible to know all possible fields in advance (because items are processed on-by-one), but we need to know it to write a CSV header. With a single Item class a set of its defined fields can be used. But whith several item classes this doesn't work, and `FEED_EXPORT_FIELDS` allows to specify which fields should be in result. 
2. In Scrapy master it is possible to yield raw dicts instead of Item instances; FEED_EXPORT_FIELDS allows to define fields to export for the cases dicts have different keys (e.g. when keys for empty values are omitted).

(1) won't work if you define `FEED_EXPORT_FIELDS` per Item class. 

A set of fields defined in Item is essentially a per-item `FEED_EXPORT_FIELDS`. 
Do you want to skip some fields on export time even if they are defined?

"
5642,Neutral,@redapple does opening xn----7sbb4ac0ad0be6cf.xn--p1ai work for you?
5643,Negative,"Hi Everyone, first of all sorry for creating this distraction, I'm sure you all have plenty of real work to do.  Also @kmike and @redapple, thank you for your productive approach on this, I'll do my best to match your tone.  My main point is to simply make you aware of my experience when I tried to on-board as a contributor.  I ran into a roadblock due to the language of this document, and I wanted to make you aware that using it as a greeting may be having some unintended consequences.  And as I mentioned above, I agree with the high-level goal of encouraging contributors to treat each other with respect, but I'm finding this particular implementation to be a bit buggy.

The first problem I encountered is that it unnecessarily focuses on lots of negative behavior.  The document provides a list of antisocial activities and a list of classes which should be protected from these activities.  In doing so the document splits the pool of potential contributors into aggressors and victims, and it's up to the reader to figure out where they fit in.  The document also implicitly paints the reader as someone who needs to be warned against engaging in this type of behavior, otherwise it would not be required reading.  This is a fairly pessimistic perspective, and it's somewhat demeaning if you happen to believe that people are innately good.  A more productive approach would be to assume benevolence on the part of all participants, and instead focus on the qualities which make up the ideal contributor.  You will find that the tone of this document becomes much more productive if you take every negative activity that it describes and replace it with its positive counterpart.

The second problem is that all of this negativity is placed at the beginning of the on-boarding pipeline.  Imagine for a second that you're invited to a friend's house to bake a pie.  And you love pie, so you're really looking forward to helping them improve their recipes.  But when you show up at their house, they greet you with a lecture on politics and morality instead of anything regarding pies.  Then they take you around the house and say things like ""do not kick the cat, do not break the windows, do not make advances toward my grandmother, do not relieve yourself on the floor"".  This language is not appropriate for the situation, it's not a pleasant way to greet someone, and pretty soon you're going to change your mind about the pie.

The third problem is how it handles conflict resolution between the reporter and the accused.  Many of the problems described in this document will depend on how the reporter perceives the intentions of the accused.  The difference between perception and intent may be due to a misunderstanding, cultural differences, or some other external factor.  Productive conflict resolution would bring both parties to the table and go over the experience of each participant in an effort to bridge their differences.  However, this document prescribes that reporter of an incident should remain anonymous, which is counter to how these things are handled in the real world.

@kmike - You make a fair point regarding the BSD license.  Every project has some amount of boilerplate which serves its purpose in 1-in-1000000 scenarios.  However, the language of the CoC is much less user-friendly than the text you quoted.  If we had to transform one text into the other, then the CoC would read something along the lines of ""We expect all contributors to behave professionally, and treat each other with respect"".  While the BSD text would first describe a list of undesirable products, then a host of unethical activities, and then finally make the point that the contributors do not endorse any of those things. 

@redapple - It sounds like you handled those situations appropriately.  I can certainly see how it's useful to have a document that explicitly states the course of action that will be taken in those cases.  Again, my experience is only from the perspective of on-boarding.  Also, the bulk of my response was meant to answer the questions you asked, let me know if you think I'm misinterpreting anything."

5650,Neutral,"@foromer4 Scrapy has two request queues - in Scheduler and in Downloader. Downloader uses a small in-memory buffer for requests (its size is equal to CONCURRENT_REQUESTS); it is the component which ensures concurrency limits and download timeouts are respected. Scheduler stores all requests; it can store them either in memory or on disk (see https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/jobs.html). So request is first retrieved from Scheduler queue, put to Downloader queue, and then Downloader downloads it.

""Graceful stop"" (a single Ctrl-C) means that a spider stops retrieving requests form Scheduler and waits for Downloader queue to become empty. Double Ctrl-C means spider is stopped immediately - currently it means that all requests in Downloader queue are dropped."

It is still a long road to full Python 3 support, but we're in a much better shape now - ~~480~~ 507 tests are passing in Python 3, compared to 248 before the sprint.

"
5672,Neutral,"Yeah, it looks like that. To make it somehow work you can assign a high priority for these new requests, i.e. use `.replace(body=..., priority=1000)`. This way requests with time set will be processed without a large delay. You also need to check that the body is only replaced once, e.g. you can put a flag to request.meta. 

I think as a hack you can also use `request._body = ...` and don't return a new request.

"
5683,Neutral,May I take this?
5684,Positive,"I'm new, so here's a quick intro: Hi! I'm Jakob :) I've also put some thoughts into add-on management for my GSoC proposal.

I don't think Scrapy should continue when there is an error while loading one of the add-ons. Depending on the add-on it probably means a substantial change in functionality (e.g. results are lost when a pipeline add-on fails). The user should be made to explicitly acknowledge that by disabling the add-on herself, not just be informed through a warning message or similar. Instead of marking an add-on as non-critical they might as well start the spider for a second and see if there are any problems.

I'm not sure if there is an advantage in an `AddOn` class: If we force existing extensions (e.g. a pipeline) to subclass it, this would forbid add-ons from using multiple hooks (an add-on could no longer consist of a pipeline _and_ a Spider middleware, etc.). If we make developers define a new class for their addon (subclassing `AddOn`), we might as well make them define a module/`.py` file, thereby enforcing clearer structure (one file/module per addon) and freeing us from having to instantiate the add-on class.

For the dependency trees, maybe as a first step towards a full-fledged solution the add-ons could be advised to supply some additional variables (besides their name and version), e.g. `REQUIRES`, `MODIFIES`, `PROVIDES`. A rather simple function in the add-on manager could then check whether the requirement of one add-on is in the `MODIFIES` and `PROVIDES` lists other add-ons.
"
5685,Neutral,"@BuGoNee , so you found the root problem?
"
5686,Neutral,"MIME uses us-ascii to encode characters, hence not able to encode the non US-ASCII
characters. Hence to encode the non US-Ascii characters you must add ""utf-8"" for
encoding.
Use of

part1 = MIMEText(u'\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u3001\u4e16\u754c\uff01\n',
                 ""plain"", ""utf-8"")

It will enable the MIMEText to use utf-8 for encoding the non us-ascii characters.

A small change of this in the def send function will work.

```
  body_msg = msg.attach(MIMEText(body))

    my_msg = msg.as_string().encode('ascii')
    if encoding['my_msg'] == 'ascii':
        dfd = self._sendmail(rcpts, msg.as_string())
    else:
        part1 = MIMEText(body_msg, ""plain"", ""utf-8"")
```

The above code is just to explain how the issue can be solved.

After your comments and idea to improve the solution, I will send
Pull Request to merge with the Scrapy source code.

5689,Neutral,"@tonal , I believe the reason is because of the Content-Type value.
See https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/193 for a discussion on how browsers handle `application/gzip` responses.
Here, the content-type is `application/octet-stream`, so HttpCompressionMiddleware leaves it as it is.

5690,Positive,"well, cmd doesn't seem to recognize contents in single quotes as a single string, as i got ""crawl: error: running 'scrapy crawl' with more than one spider is no longer supported"" from the command line ""scrapy crawl ratemyprof -o 'C:\Users\Public\Music\Sample Music\scrapy' -t csv""

double quotes don't work either. The spiders will work, but the output csv will not be saved to the absolute directory. 

After much trial and error, I found the working open parentheses solution.

"
5691,Neutral,"@kmike first of all we change priority, so requests will rotate. I don't know what do you mean by a busy loop; but the heaviest task is reading the request from the queue and this is something the scheduler can't avoid.
"
5692,Neutral,"To do that use `from_crawler` method - see http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/extensions.html#writing-your-own-extension. I think this is a documentation bug - it is not clear that Scrapy middlewares have the same features as extensions. Accessing settings is a common use case, I think we should provide examples in middleware docs, even if they are redundant.

5695,Negative,"Hi @mrsinguyen,

This is a lxml installation problem: lxml tries to build against libxml installed by MAMP, but for some reason this fails. It seems it is MAMP to blame because Apple distributes libxml with OS X, and MAMP version shouldn't take precedence. I'm not an user of MAMP myself (I use homebrew to get software); for me lxml installs fine on 10.8.4. Maybe uninstalling MAMP could help, or maybe you could try changing some environment variables set by MAMP, I don't know.

Unfortunately, scrapy can't fix this issue: you will have to figure out how to install lxml on your system.

5708,Negative,"The TypeScript language service needs some means of ensuring that formatting doesn't occur in certain contexts, like pressing `Enter` during completion sessions.

As an example, the code `new Array<n` is a valid expression in JavaScript/TypeScript. It's semantically the same as `(new Array()) < n`. 

A user might want to complete `n` with `number`, and press `Enter` at its entry in a completion list, because the intent might have been to eventually write `new Array<number>()`.

However, upon pressing `Enter`, formatting is triggered and the user ends up formatting the code as `new Array < number`. This is undesirable because we are unsure of the immediate intent.

**Expected Behavior**:
A namespace import is added for `Z.SomeAttribute` on both method and local function parameter.
```

using Z;

namespace X
{
    class C
    {
        static void M([Some] string p1)
        {
            void N(string p2)
            {
            }

            N(string.Empty);
        }
    }
}
---

using Z;

namespace X
{
    class C
    {
        static void M(string p1)
        {
            void N([Some] string p2)
            {
            }

            N(string.Empty);
        }
    }
}
```

**Actual Behavior**:
Namespace import fails silently for `Z.SomeAttribute` on local function `X.C.M.N`. It seems that because of this, the simplifier leaves the attribute untouched.
```

using Z;

namespace X
{
    class C
    {
        static void M([Some] string p1)
        {
            void N(string p2)
            {
            }

            N(string.Empty);
        }
    }
}
---

namespace X
{
    class C
    {
        static void M(string p1)
        {
            void N([global::Z.SomeAttribute] string p2)
            {
            }

            N(string.Empty);
        }
    }

5716,Negative,"Currently, if I write a method like this:

```
public async Task<int> FooAsync()
{
    return 42;
}
```

The compiler emits the following warning:

> This async method lacks 'await' operators and will run synchronously. Consider using the 'await' operator to await non-blocking API calls, or 'await Task.Run(...)' to do CPU-bound work on a background thread

And if I look at the IL, I can see that the compiler actually emits a state machine, even tough none is needed.

I think this behavior could be improved.
- First, the compiler could just emit `return Task.FromResult(42)` (and do the same for every `return x`) if the method body contains no `await`. This would avoid the overhead of creating a state machine.
- Second, the warning is annoying. The fact that I use `await` or not in the body is just an implementation detail. If I change the implementation so that I no longer need `await`, I have to remove the `async` modifier and change every `return x` to `return Task.FromResult(x)` to avoid the warning. In some cases I could change the method signature to return `T` instead of `Task<T>`, but it's not always possible (e.g. if I'm implementing an interface or overriding a base class method). And if I change the implementation to make it asynchronous again, I have to do the opposite. IMO, the `async` modifier with no `await` should just mean ""implicitly wrap any return value in a completed task"". 

`async` without `await` should just be treated as a degenerate case, be optimized as such, and not emit a warning.

5718,Negative,"See also DevDiv.979836 — we need a mechanism to re-try failed file load cases

It is quite common for generated files to be included in the project. When the workspace is trying to read this file, it might get access denied. This results in discrepancy between Error List and actual build output and bogus build errors. This is a bad experience, and a regression from the old language service. We haven't seen this many issues of this nature before Roslyn.

We could try retrying 10 times spaced out by 200 ms. Or use FileShare.ReadWrite or FileShare.Delete, which are more forgiving than FileShare.Read. Or both.

From @Pilchie:
In the native C# language service, we used to have a single retry after 1 second which alleviated many of these sort of issues.

From @heejaechang:

currently, when a workspace try to read a file content, for whatever reason if it fails, it raise workspace failed event and move on. and remains that way until something happens to that file again.

this is a problem since this could cause a lot of errors to show up in IDE. since those file either contains empty content or staled content from whatever it used to have, this will make some errors to show up for that project, but if there is p2p reference to this project, especially skeleton assembly, then, this could cause even more errors to show up in all those project that transitively depends on this project.

what I am observing is when we build or tf sync or even when we load project, if we happen to be out of luck, we gets a lot of this failures and hence a lot of errors in IDE. (I included what I have in my VS right now below)

I think this make IDE experience quite bad. since there is no easy way to fix this once it happens. close solution and re-loading might not fix it sometimes, you need to do that several times sometimes.

so, I think we need a way to mitigate this issue. I think we need some mechanism that listen to this workspace failure events and re-load them.

## Summary
All branching keywords like `break`, `continue`, `goto` and most of all `return` should be highlighted in a different color as the standard keyword color.

In Visual Studio and VS Code my suggestion is violet instead of blue.

## Motiviation
Branch points should be visible in a method without any further ado for the reader. No marking of one keyword and get all equivalent keywords highlighted should be required.

## Variations
`break`s in `switch` statements are expected and belong to the constructs normal appearance. They could be kept in the standard highlight color.

             orderby elem.test descending
             select elem.baz;
```

is easer to read than this:

``` csharp
var result = collection
             .Where(_ => _.foo == ""bar"")
             .OrderBy(_ => elem.test)
             .Reverse()
             .Select(_ => _.baz);
```

So I would like to propose more LINQ keywords like `reverse`, `min`, `max`, `count`, `first`, `last`, `oftype`, `tolist`, `toarray` etc. to be implemented.
I would also like to propose the possibility of _""registering""_ own extension methods as valid LINQ keywords. This should not effect the actual compiled code to much, as the query syntax is converted into the method syntax during compile-time.

I could imagine something as follows:

``` csharp
public static class MyExtensionMethods
{
    [LINQExtension(""shuffle"")]
    public static IEnumerable<T> Shuffle<T>(this IEnumerable<T> source)
    {
        // function logic goes here
    }

    [LINQExtension(""print"")]
    public static IEnumerable<T> Print<T>(this IEnumerable<T> source, T element)
    {
    if (element == null)
            Console.WriteLine("" null! "");
        else
            Console.WriteLine(element.ToString());
    }
}

public static class Test
{
    public static int Main(string[] argv)
    {
        int[] collection1 = ....;
        object[] collection2 = ....;

        IEnumerable<int> range1 = from i in collection1
                                  where i < 100
                                  where i > 20
                                  select i
                                  shuffle;
        // the extension method ""shuffle"" could be found by the compiler and compiled

        IEnumerable<object> range2 = from o in collection2
                                     where o.foo == ""test""
                                     print o.bar
                                     foo;
         // the extension method ""foo"" could NOT be found, so the compiler would generate some error like this:
         //     ERROR CS... ON LINE ...: The LINQ Extension method 'foo' could not be found in the current assembly
         // but the exension method ""print"" would be found and compiled
    }
}
```

5736,Neutral,"In the following code samples, the completion list preselects ""object"" and will complete as expected on '{'. However, this gets in the way of typing an anonymous type.

``` C#
object o = new |
```

``` C#
static void M1()
{
    M2(new |
}

static void M2(object o) { }
```

There really isn't a reason in the C# language to ever type `new object {`. So, the solution is to tweak completion in this case to not commit on '{' when the preselected type is `System.Object`. This is similar to how completion works when typing '=' in a using directive.

5739,Neutral,"**Version Used**: 
Microsoft (R) Visual C# Compiler version 2.3.2.61928 (ec1cde8b)

**Steps to Reproduce**:
Compile the following program in release:
```C#
class Program
{
    static void Main() { }

    static string Create1(int a, int b, int c) =>
        string.Format(
            ""{0} "" +
            ""{1} "" +
            ""{2} "",
            a, b, c);

    static string Create2(int a, int b, int c) =>
        $""{a} "" +
        $""{b} "" +
        $""{c} "";
}
```

**Expected Behavior**:
In both cases, we'd end up with a single input string and array to the underlying Format call.

**Actual Behavior**:
The first example results in a single input string and array:
```
  IL_0000:  ldstr      ""{0} {1} {2} ""
  IL_0005:  ldarg.0
  IL_0006:  box        [System.Runtime]System.Int32
  IL_000b:  ldarg.1
  IL_000c:  box        [System.Runtime]System.Int32
  IL_0011:  ldarg.2
  IL_0012:  box        [System.Runtime]System.Int32
  IL_0017:  call       string [System.Runtime]System.String::Format(string,
                                                                    object,
                                                                    object,

````
but rather than effectively concatening the interpolations, the second example results in three distinct arrays and format calls, resulting in three intermediate strings that then need to be concatenated:
```

This is relevant, because splitting string literals across lines with `+` is a common way of avoiding really long lines, and it'd be nice to be able to do the same thing with string interpolation without taking the further perf hit."

I tried using the VB compiler API to classify the conversion between the right-side of the compound assignment statement (the numeric literal, `1`) and the type of the left-side (`System.Byte`). My expectation is that this would classify as a narrowing-numeric conversion since `1` has the type, `System.Int32`. However, I was surprised to get back a widening-numeric conversion. Is this by design, or a bug? If it's by design, why?

5748,Neutral,"I have a custom static analyser that is used to verify compiled assemblies against various business standards (is it strong named, is the Authenticode signature valid, etc.), and part of the analyser includes reading the `VS_VERSIONINFO` data out of the portable executable to check the Win32 file information is correct.

I've noticed that if the `[AssemblyTrademark]` attribute is empty (i.e. `[assembly: AssemblyTrademark("""")]`), the `LegalTrademarks` value returns garbage, which then in turn breaks the alignment of values beyond it in the structure, causing more garbage values and the reading of the structure to terminate early.

The same code compiled on a machine with Visual Studio 2013 (and not Visual Studio 2015) has the correct version information, so it looks like an issue with the Roslyn compiler's implementation.

I get the same problem compiling locally on a Windows 7 SP1 x64 machine, so it isn't specific to AppVeyor.

The raw bytes of the `VS_VERSIONINFO` section (at least the best that I can represent them here) are below.

From looking at the bytes, I _think_ that there's an extra null character being emitted when the value is blank.

5749,Neutral,"If signatures in an interface include inaccessible types, it is only legal for a public type to explicitly implement that interface.

I still get a lightbulb suggestion/refactoring to try the (bogus) implicit implementation:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5943573/8915092/c63619b8-3457-11e5-91e9-c5c0c1ef7718.png)

"
5750,Neutral,"We were still discussing whether this should default to ""global scope"" or ""use scope"". As a result it was not implemented to report either and now crashes with ""Unreachable""

We should report something. It seems we are leaning towards ""global scope"".
We can change that later, but we should report something. 
"
5751,Neutral,"## Proposition

An easy way to implement default constructor that only bind the parameter of class properties
## Situation

When you have a class/struct and want to enforce the initialization through constructor we have to do something like this:

``` csharp
public class Access
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public bool IsActive { get; set; }


    public Access( // It's obvious that it's the constructos for Access class, is's inside it!
        string name, // Have to duplicate the name and type of the property
        bool isActive) // Again the name and type of the property
    {
        this.Name = name; // Obvious associations
        this.IsActive = isActive; // Obvious associations
    }
}
```

Why not write something like:

``` csharp
public class Access
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public bool IsActive { get; set; }

    public(Name, IsActive = true)
}
```

We could even use DataContracts and remove the necessity to validate the parameters, it would be very helpful for creating small helper classes.

``` csharp
public class Access
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public bool IsActive { get; set; }

    public([NotNull]Name, IsActive = true)
}
```

5757,Negative,"Sorry to dredge this up again.

Is there not (also?) an issue with the dynamic runtime here?

Having decided that as the reuslt of `Api1()` is implicitly convertible to `false` there is no need to evaluate `Api2()` in order to evaluate the first `&&`, should the result not be `false` rather than a `Waffle` instance?

In the static binder, the first `&&` is known to be a `bool&&` and so the result is a `bool`. Having decided that the first `&&` is a `bool&&`, should the dynamic runtime not pass a `bool` result onwards?
"
5758,Positive,"@alrz Nice thought, but in order to use an extension on an object I would need to expose that object, which I do not wish to do in this case.  All interactions with the `Runspace` instance need to be mediated by my wrapper class(es).  In order to attain proper isolation using extension properties I would have to create, instantiate and expose yet another wrapper object... at which point I am back where I started with an Indexer class with all of the same issues.

I suppoort #6136 in principle - I think it'd be a nice feature to have - but don't see a simple implementation path.  Indexed properties (named indexers) already have been implemented in VB so there are no obvious impediments to C# implementation.  This is a comparatively simple feature to add.
"
5759,Neutral,"@rainersigwald 

Right now we are catching most of the exceptions that come from our ToolTask, printing them (to your log), and then returning a failure error-code.  (you can see our current implementation (here)[http://source.roslyn.io/#Microsoft.Build.Tasks.CodeAnalysis/ManagedCompiler.cs,473])

Should we be doing error handling at this level, or should we allow our exceptions to percolate up to MSBuild for it to be handled there?"

However, you're welcome to open an issue on csharplang and continue discussion of the proposal. If there were enough community support it is possible (though unlikely in my opinion) that we would devote resources to this instead of the scores of (in my opinion) more valuable proposals under consideration.
"
5762,Neutral,"We have an option to ""Diagnose"" xml doc comments but not emit them, but that also triggers all the other warnings and errors, and so I don't think VS integration sets it.

We might need some finer grained control over the compiler's handling of xml doc comments.  I remember discussing this with @amcasey a LONG time ago, but I don't think we resolved anything.
"
5763,Neutral,"If there is an extensibility point in the compiler that would allow special project types to add/remove simplification fixes, then this should be filed at aspnet/Razor.

If there is not, I guess it won't be easy to make this for Razor only. Then the issue would either be ""add such extensibility point"", or add simplification fix for `string.ToString()` but that wouldn't have the effect you are looking for.

Finally, I am not sure how Razor works, but if it is boxing `Something` then including/excluding `.ToString()` would make a difference if `Something` had a `ToString()` method that hides the `object.ToString()` one  - which I agree is not a common scenario, but the greying out would kind of rely on an implementation detail.

Is your concern readability or performance? I would expect that `string.ToString()` gets optimized out.
"
5764,Neutral,">  but wouldn't it give you a hard time to rewrite the mentioned field names with the compiler generated synthesized field names

I think you're misunderstanding how the compiler works.  The compiler will just ""bind"" the references in the getter/setter to this field symbol.  The field symbol will be emitted with a special name.  But the emitting for the field references shoudl happen naturally and transparently.
"
5765,Neutral,"Yes there might be something else going on, as the project that I'm trying to open is part of a fairly complex solution (not open source unfortunately). The problem is certainly references like the one above, because if I comment out ""<ReferenceOutputAssembly>false</ReferenceOutputAssembly>"", the project opens. However, I tried to find a minimal repro with a toy project, and failed so far. Are there any know issues in Roslyn 1.0 that result in the exception above, and that can be avoided by not using  ""<ReferenceOutputAssembly>false</ReferenceOutputAssembly>""?

C# gets in the way [because that's what it was designed to do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29#Design_goals).  

If you want to write code that disregards correctness in favour of performance, you should be writing that code in a language that doesn't enforce correctness (C/C++), not trying to make a correctness-enforcing language less so. Especially since scenarios where performance is preferable to correctness, is an extremely tiny minority of C# use cases.
"
5768,Negative,"@CyrusNajmabadi,

You really aren't listening. No one is saying that a decision on a new discussion medium need be made straight away, or that ""something happens immediately "". Quite the opposite: that decision needs to be reached, in due course, after discussion with the community.

The only thing that needs to happen very soon, is for the team to acknowledge that the mailing list wasn't the right solution and that alternative options will be proposed to the community. Sure we likely will have to wait for those proposals until after VS2017 goes live. That's not a problem. The only problem is you appearing to refuse to acknowledge our rejection of the mailing list as the discussion forum. "
5769,Neutral,"Well, we seem too have different expectation as to what LangaugeLevel should do.

You say you have enabled optimizations in the past, but there is an underlying change in language semantics that is much harder to identify as a root cause than a `MissingMethodException`. And, it's not (just) an optimization.

I disabled optimizations in my bug hunting, and the failures remained. Portraying it as an optimization isn't quite exact - it's clearly a change in semantics. Quite close to a language feature, IMO. I admit that the semantics were not the failure mode for me, but treating them based on the `LanguageLevel` certainly would have helped, and is likely to help others bitten by that issue.

I like the change, in fact when I found out about it I wondered why it was not in C# 2.0, but given its slightly lopsided introduction please consider a more cautious `if`.

I'm trying to do exactly the same thing, parsing a top-level expression into a LINQ expression tree (btw, it looks like this is a very recurrent scenario, would be great if it was trivial to solve in Roslyn).

Anyway, **GetSemanticModel** is throwing an **ArgumentException** for me in the following example:

``` csharp
var script = @""1+1"";
var tree = CSharpSyntaxTree.ParseText(script, new CSharpParseOptions(kind:SourceCodeKind.Interactive));
var root = (ExpressionSyntax)tree.GetRoot().DescendantNodes().OfType<ExpressionSyntax>().First();
var compilation = CSharpCompilation.CreateSubmission(""ScriptTest"");
var semantics = compilation.GetSemanticModel(tree, ignoreAccessibility:false);
var type = semantics.GetTypeInfo(root);
```

I've tried adding the syntax tree before calling **GetSemanticModel** or changing the _ignoreAccessibility_ argument and it's still throwing with a cryptic message **_""Additional information: tree""**_.

Is the semantic computation of interactive expressions still not supported in the current pre-release?

5782,Neutral,"We are now taking language feature discussion in other repositories:
- https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang for C# specific issues
- https://github.com/dotnet/vblang for VB-specific features
- https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang for features that affect both languages

Features that are under active design or development, or which are ""championed"" by someone on the language design team, have already been moved either as issues or as checked-in design documents. For example, the proposal in this repo ""Proposal: Partial interface implementation a.k.a. Traits"" (issue 16139 and a few other issues that request the same thing) are now tracked by the language team at issue 52 in https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues, and there is a draft spec at https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/proposals/default-interface-methods.md and further discussion at issue 288 in https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues. Prototyping of the compiler portion of language features is still tracked here; see, for example, https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/tree/features/DefaultInterfaceImplementation and issue 17952.

In order to facilitate that transition, we have started closing language design discussions from [the roslyn repo](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) with a note briefly explaining why. When we are aware of an existing discussion for the feature already in the new repo, we are adding a link to that. But we're not adding new issues to the new repos for existing discussions in this repo that the language design team does not currently envision taking on. Our intent is to eventually close the language design issues in the Roslyn repo and encourage discussion in one of the new repos instead.

Our intent is not to shut down discussion on language design - you can still continue discussion on the closed issues if you want - but rather we would like to encourage people to move discussion to where we are more likely to be paying attention (the new repo), or to abandon discussions that are no longer of interest to you.

If you happen to notice that one of the closed issues has a relevant issue in the new repo, and we have not added a link to the new issue, we would appreciate you providing a link from the old to the new discussion. That way people who are still interested in the discussion can start paying attention to the new issue.

Also, we'd welcome any ideas you might have on how we could better manage the transition. Comments and discussion about closing and/or moving issues should be directed to https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/18002. Comments and discussion about this issue can take place here or on an issue in the relevant repo.

Right now, only values can be retrieved from a Dictionary - not the key.  Unless iterating through the dictionary with a foreach loop - which would be prohibitively expensive when doing a simple look up.  It would be nice if a method could be provided that would return the key/value pair for a given key from a matching ""key"".  The reason why it would be useful is because the Equals method does not necessarily mean that 2 objects are exactly equal - since the Equals method can and often does only use a subset of the fields of a class to make that determination.  I have come across cases where it would have been quite helpful to access the stored key in the dictionary when my code found the item in the dictionary.  There were other fields in the stored key that I needed to access that were not present in the key used to access the dictionary, so I had to use the suggested work around given in the link above.

5803,Negative,"This proposal seems even worse than the one for hiding variables inside properties. If you really need `/* my very complicated getter logic */` or `/* my even more complicated setter logic */`, then use methods. Properties are intended to be a way of encapsulating a field; not a place to put complex logic.

5804,Neutral,"If your expectation is to get an operator like `bool.operator |(bool, bool)`, when `||` appears in the source, then that is reasonable and this could be considered a bug. If you expect `bool.operator ||(bool, bool)` then that isn't reasonable."
5805,Neutral,"Has there been any movement on this in the nightlies? Not the suggestion to change the language (though that would be awesome too), just interested in getting extension method support in scripts for now... Has it been discussed how this will implemented within the team yet?

I'm not particularly fond of introducing magic directives that are specific to the scripting compiler. Lifting any class that contains extensions seems like a more general approach to me.

Another thought I had was to create overloads and/or fluent extensions to the scripting APIs that allow passing in additional script code that goes outside the submission class. Then you could put whatever you needed in there, including static classes with extension methods. In cases like ScriptCS where you want the whole thing to be captured in a single text file or string, the Roslyn scripting consumers would be responsible for implementing the functionality however it's appropriate for them (with the `#extensions` directive, using a delimiter between global and nested code, etc.).

```
string globalCode = @""
    public static class MyExtensions
    {
        //...
    }
"";

string scriptCode = @""
    //...
"";

ScriptOptions options = new ScriptOptions()

CSharpScript.Eval(scriptCode, options);

We use the metadata only when we are calculating the IL/metadata delta. I assume the module won't be unloaded during that time (the debugger is in break state). Instead of the debugger notifying us about metadata that were unloaded it would be simpler if we called the method each time we need the metadata. On our side we could then cache symbols built from the metadata based on whether we get the same answer (pointer, size) as we did last time. If we don't we throw the symbols away and rebuild them from the new metadata.

My proposal would be to let `switch` be as it is, and remain with whatever meaning it has in C# as of now. However additionally we could introduce a more powerful, say, `match`, which doesn't have fallthrough behaviour, and works with pattern matching. Like this:

```
match (contactInfo)
{
    case Telephone(var t): Console.WriteLine($""We have a telephone number: {t}"");
    // no implicit fallthrough
    case Email(var e): => Console.WriteLine($""We have an email address: {e}"");
}
```

instead of

```
switch (contactInfo)
{
    case Telephone(var t): Console.WriteLine($""We have a telephone number: {t}"");
    break;
    case Email(var e): => Console.WriteLine($""We have an email address: {e}"");
    break;
}

It wouldn't be true for `foreach`.  Because `Arguments<T>` is a concrete type the `foreach` loop can take advantage of the `struct` enumerator on the type.  This avoids the heap allocation.

If you used `LINQ` methods then yes that would cause the allocation.  But that is true for every collection type though due to the architecture of the enumerator pattern.

On top of this i'd like some system to be made available for the types that this pattern doesn't work on.  If we have both, then i think that's going to make pattern matching very viable with very low friction.
"
5820,Neutral,"@MgSam I don't know what others think and I don't think that it's so much about typing but with the new _proposed_ syntax when you write something like `foo.1` you know that it's a tuple just by looking at it, much like you can reason about indexers today e.g. `foo[0]` I think that it certainly make things easier.

With `foo.Item1` we can only _assume_ that it is but it's not as obvious as it can be.

"
5821,Neutral,"@VSadov that is correct for simple FXCop rules. However, for FXCop/SDL dataflow rules based on Phoenix analysis engine, we end up skipping analysis completely for all methods, except one. This leads to incorrect call graph and hence incorrect analysis. I am working on trying to fix the Phoenix pereader to handle this case of multiple methods sharing same start RVA, so that such symbols can share identical function units for analysis and we generate a correct callgraph.

Yes, the SDL dataflow rule tests that regressed with new compiler can be fixed /changed, they are specifically validating that the errors are fired for each identical method, but the new behavior also seems reasonable as we will fire on at least one method. They are more concerned about broken dataflow/callgraph.

An expression form of `switch` is common in functional languages for pattern matching.  You're right that the syntax is largely unnecessary as the same functionality can be accomplished through nested `if`/`else` or ternary operators.  Although a single `switch` can optimize better by reusing patterns.

Functional languages also often have list/query comprehension, but C# already has that and it's called LINQ.  I see no reason to duplicate it yet again.  I disagree that you're syntax is sufficiently ""better"" than all of the current existing forms.

There's a sort-of tangential issue around being able to treat unmanaged memory as `T[]` which the proposal mentions. I'd like to be able to do this for (e.g.) passing `byte*` to `Stream`s (without first copying it into a `byte[]`), but this could probably be handled as (another!) `Stream` method.

"
5882,Negative,"@gafter 

That it would.  But if you changed the second `y` to a `z` then you would not be permitted to use either identifier as neither could be proven to be definitely assigned.

I wouldn't argue for altering that behavior in normal Boolean expressions.  However I do think that pattern matching with `switch` and `match` would be quite handicapped if it didn't have support for both ""OR"" patterns as well as permitting reuse of the identifier where the compiler could prove that the variable could only receive a value from one of the patterns.  Notably F# already supports this with ""OR"" patterns and requires that both sides bind the same set of variables:

``` fsharp
let result =
    match point with
    | (0, x) | (5, x) -> x
    | (10, x) | (15, y) -> x // ERROR: The two sides of this 'or' pattern bind different sets of variables
    | _ -> 0
```

@alrz Maybe not, but it seems weird to have two ways to express Boolean logic and they apply to completely different places.  Can't say I care for `unless` either, evaluating backwards lexically is very unintuitive.

verbosity is one of the advantages of C#, just see the 'superfluid' `abstract` keyword on the before the `class` keyword, because it is clear that it must be an abstract class, as at least one function inside is abstract - greetings from C++ ;-)

The syntax and grammar that C# chose to adopt comes with an assumption of behavior, including scope.  Sure, C# has deviated in a variety of areas, particularly where it beat C++ to the punch (if `var` were a new proposal today I would be arguing that `auto` be the keyword).  This is of the biggest deviations and directly contrary to the existing behaviors that have previously been hammered out through standardization.  These arguments have all already happened.

Apart from the insanely late timeframe of these changes (seriously, you're talking RC2 here, there should be *nothing* even remotely up for discussion), what's worse is that this decision pollutes the entire future of pattern matching in the language.

The way it works there is that the attribute class has to inherit from `MulticastAttribute` and have `[MulticastAttributeUsage]`. When you then apply that attribute for example on a class, PostSharp understands that it should apply to all its members.

Not sure what that means for this proposal: on one hand, it shows demand for such feature, on the other, it shows that something similar can be implemented without language support.

5894,Positive,"@gafter Great point.  The compiler could spit out a private static function that accepts the original range variable (or a tuple of all current range variables) and returns an `IEnumerable<tuple>` of the original range variable(s) plus the variable patterns, then `yield return` a single result on a match.

Going with implicit filtering:

``` cs
from person in list
let Student { Grade is var grade, Name is var name } = person
where grade > 65
select new { Grade = grade, Name = name };
```

converted (somewhat) into:

Per file configuration sounds frustrating - would you want to fiddle with settings each time you open a file and add two lines to it? 

And true, mixed indentation in one file is definitively bad practice, but it happens in real world. As a result of multiple devs with different indentation settings eventually editing the same file, for example.

I don't think requiring adding an attribute to your generated types is crazy, but I'm also considering whether or not it's too expensive to use semantic analysis to trigger the generation. This would let you apply the attribute to some interface or base type, then every type that implements/overrides those types would automatically trigger generation.

I had this issue this morning on a single WPF project (VS 2017 15.3.3) solution.

The task ServiceHub.RoslynCodeAnalysisService32.exe stayed running after I closed and trying to kill it through task manager only showed 'Access denied' message.

I solved it through an elevated command prompt running taskkill. But it would not completely kill the process:

ERROR: The process ""12528"" not found.`

The interesting thing to note, and what finally allowed me to close this task, was Process ID: 1360, which was Windows Explorer (not file explorer) but windows itself. After killing the windows process, I was able to end both Roslyn and Devenv without further issues. Restarting explorer through Task manager brought windows back.

I hope this could help, let me know if you need anything else. I get this issue a lot.

- Lack of mentioning aliasing analysis work for overlapping references

The easiest solution is to deepcopy everywhere and make everything mutable and let CLR/RyuJIT deal with it, but essentially those are what kills performance. What gives performance is constant/immutable references and copy-as-needed per mutation. String is already immutable which should make it easy to slice. I'm neither aliasing nor GC expert, so I can't comment on the problem of 'small ref holding onto large superset'. I'm hoping this is a problem experts have previously tackled and have mitigation strategies.
"
5933,Negative,"@HaloFour I guess I do see the value in these points...

re. mutability, I don't find it to be such a huge issue given that `readonly` does protect against modifying members of the struct (somehow I wasn't aware of this).

Specifically, the following is not allowed:

``` c#
struct Point { public int x; public int y; }
readonly Point p = new Point { x = 1, y = 2 };
p.x = 3;

If somehow you could declare `readonly` for locals, that would be great, but local variables are already mutable by default anyway, so this doesn't seem hugely inconsistent.

5934,Negative,"@tenor 

I have some problems to see the compatibility between your original ""the spec says the code is fine"" and ""the spec backs your claim"", because I understand that the code I posted was wrong (= the compiler thinks differently than what I expect). But this is precisely the problem with abstract, without-code-sample talking and why I don't want to continue this conversation (IMHO, a pointless waste of time).

> There could be potential overloads

Logically, but you were using this text to refer to a scenario where only one overload was present. Do you want to consider multiple overloads? Excellent! Show a code or explain how the described behaviour works under such conditions. But using a given spec to justify/criticise a completely different situation doesn't seem too correct.

> That's why the compiler allows the code

Again no. This is a 1-overload scenario, the multiple-overload rules don't apply here. Your spec is applied when determining which overload, out of various ones, should be used. Here there is no possible confusion; just one overload, no doubt about which one to use. 

The following code does illustrate a multi-overload scenario:

``` C#
private static void CallingMethod()
{
    //DateTime dateVar = ReturnString(""""); //It doesn't compile.

    dynamic dynamicVar = new DateTime(); // """";
    DateTime dateVar = ReturnString(dynamicVar); //Now it compiles.
}

private static string ReturnString(string arg)
{
    return arg;
}

private static string ReturnString(DateTime arg)
{
    return arg.ToString();
}
```

If you test this code, you would see that there is no confusion here either: `dynamic dynamicVar = new DateTime();` provokes `ReturnString(DateTime arg)` to be selected; and dynamic `dynamicVar = """"; ReturnString(string arg)`. There is an error because of trying to store a `string` in a `DateTime` variable, but the overload-selection part works fine. Again this code shouldn't compile (because both methods return a `string` rather than the expected `DateTime` variable) and again it does. So the number of overloads doesn't seem to be an issue here; but you are free to go deeper into all this by considering more complex situations.

> calls to static methods (like in the example you provided), there will be no derived types and so the compiler should be able to catch the error

I am neither sure about what you are trying to say there nor I honestly care. See, I think that I have fully covered my being-nice promise, also that my position is quite clear. I don't want to continue with this conversion, please respect that.

If this is to happen, I'd like to see it in tandem with allowing statements at the top level, ie that class/method definitions are basically treated on the same level as statements. That would allow you to define functions outside of a class, allow for this, and allow statements at the top level (which makes it possible to treat C# as a scripting language, mentioned in #98).

    join a in svcContext.AccountSet
        on c.ContactId equals a.PrimaryContactId.Id

    {
        c.FirstName,
        c.LastName,
        a.Address1_Telephone1

and if you _really_ want to avoid the anonymous type projection entirely you can write:

``` CSharp
var query = 
    from c in svcContext.ContactSet
    join a in svcContext.AccountSet
        on c.ContactId equals a.PrimaryContactId.Id
    where c.LastName == ""Wilcox"" || c.LastName == ""Andrews""
    where a.Address1_Telephone1.Contains(""(206)"")
        || a.Address1_Telephone1.Contains(""(425)"")
    select (Action)(()=>
    {
       Console.WriteLine(""Contact Name: {0} {1}"", c.FirstName, c.LastName);
       Console.WriteLine(""Account Phone: {0}"", a.Account.Address1_Telephone1);
    });
foreach(var a in query)
{
    a();
}
```

Also the proposed example:

``` CSharp
foreach c in svcContext.ContactSet
    join a in svcContext.AccountSet
        on c.ContactId equals a.PrimaryContactId.Id
    where c.LastName == ""Wilcox"" || c.LastName == ""Andrews""
    where a.Address1_Telephone1.Contains(""(206)"")
        || a.Address1_Telephone1.Contains(""(425)"")
{
    Console.WriteLine(""Contact Name: {0} {1}"", c.FirstName, c.LastName);
    Console.WriteLine(""Account Phone: {0}"", a.Account.Address1_Telephone1);
}
```

is confusing because the scoping is, at least to me, non obvious. Since c is the range variable following `foreach`, I would not expect a to be in scope. It would only make sense if foreach were the last clause.

Other proposals for expanding LINQ syntax, such as the one proposing the ability to specify an IEqualityComparer inline (#100) add real value.

5974,Neutral,"@DavidArno Why you think it must be implied?

Ah, got it now. Thanks for taking the time to explain. In thicky-mode today :smile:  
"
5976,Neutral,"Yes, you can use decimal as a default value but that's because there's a special attribute - `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.DecimalConstantAttribute`. A similar one exists for `DateTime`.

Does this mean that when you add a user defined literal operator to a type the compiler should automatically generate such an attribute? Sounds kind of ugly because the public surface of the library containing the type will end up containing another type that's really just an implementation detail.

And assuming we go the custom attribute way, what has this to do with user defined literals? It seems to me that one could simply mark a constructor as ""const/literal/pure/etc."" to make this happen, similar to what @mirhagk suggested but only for constructors which have only primitive types as parameters.

Or, if you only care about DateTime, the C# compiler could simply treat some of the DateTime constructors specially and generate the DateTimeConstantAttribute. The language doesn't need to support DateTime literals to solve this problem.

> Allow extension methods in non-static classes

Does allowing extension methods in interfaces make sense? Consider the current scenario with `IEnumerable<T>`, had interface extension methods been available the extension methods could have been placed in the interface saving marginally on namespace pollution (instead of the current situation with `Enumerable`). This would mean that interfaces would be one step closer to becoming mixins.

    {
      Action f =(int num) => num;

This appears to be true in my limited testing for any scenario in which the lambda expression's return type cannot be converted to the expected return type of the delegate, but everything else about the lambda is valid C#. This causes `BoundExpressionExtensions.HasExpressionType` to return true, which violates the comment `// null literal, method group, and anonymous function expressions have no type.`."
5987,Neutral,"@svick API paging is very non-chatty with respect to async overhead because the HTTP call is about 1e6x more expensive.

@benaadams that is a good point, but should apply less to sequences than it applies to ""scalar"" tasks. Or does it? Maybe new patterns will emerge. But I have written quite a few IO layers of various kinds and for some reason I don't recall any instance where I had a chatty sequence based on IO. For some reason it'S either scalars or low-volume sequences.

My favorite trick to make chatty sequences non-chatty is chunking. I sometimes do: `items.AsChunked(1000).AsParallel().Select(chunk => chunk.ConvertAll(x=> ...)).AsEnumerable().Flatten()`. So that's a workaround that will apply to async sequences as well. (But so far that trick was only needed for CPU-bound work since IO is too bulky to need it.)

The problem with that entire concept is that the very target you intend is also the least likely to actually employ this feature.  Someone who slops together a giant monolithic class full of interdependencies isn't going to take the time to whittle down those dependencies into concrete scoping blocks anymore than they're likely to refactor that giant class into smaller classes.  C# shouldn't add features which encourage abuse of the language and incorrect design patterns.

5996,Neutral,"Yes.  I definitely think we shoudl have an API from the compiler to tell us what chained constructor a constructor calls.

@dotnet/roslyn-compiler 

Can we add something like this?  We have APIs to tell you this when there is a this/base call (or an invocation in VB).  However, when the chaining is implicit, it's not clear which constructor is called.  This is an issue especially with wonky constructors (like ones with optional or params parameters).
"
5997,Neutral,"I think that this would complicate the language too much just to fix a relatively rare issue. A significant benefit of GC is that you usually don't have to think about references too much, it just works.

And your proposal probably wouldn't even fix the issue completely. Consider a LINQ method like `Enumerable.Select()`: it takes a reference to a lambda (which in turn can reference some local variable) and stores it in an object which it returns. I believe this would violate your `&` constraint, which would mean you can't ever use LINQ while referencing a `&` value in the lambda.

You could try to solve this specific case somehow, but there are probably lots of other coding patterns that wouldn't work well with your proposal.

Also, wouldn't the alternative syntax invalidate much more existing code (since it would change what unadorned type of a parameter means)?

I don’t have too much to add here.  Mads is in charge to the language design process and I will gracefully defer to him in all matters concerning it.

**Problem**: _Don’t have a clear picture of what the team’s priorities are or what we are working on._

We operate internally on a 3-week sprint cycle.  We could just publish some notes updating people on what we accomplished in the past 3 weeks and what our priorities are for the next 3 weeks.  Would people want to see this or would it be too much noise?

**Problem**: _I can’t find a centralized place that can give me the tl;dr version of what’s happening._

Perhaps we should have a landing page such as [http://www.typescriptlang.org/](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) that gives people on overview of what is currently planned. We have been doing blog posts about new features but I don't think we have a grand central location for all this info.

I just wanted to say thanks to @DavidArno for starting this discussion. I am very glad that people are voicing concerns about our process and how we are designing and building Roslyn.

6000,Neutral,"From what I've seen so far: it should be easier to implement this for everything, rather than for just `typeof`. There is only `AbstractSyntaxContext` nearby, which does not have the stuff about `typeof`. I guess, it should be common for both C# and VB and the latter does not have `typeof`?
